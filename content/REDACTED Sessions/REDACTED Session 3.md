Simplified History of the War Between Gods and Dragons
- Annam and Othea procreated, giving rise to the giants
- However, Othea cheated with Utuliu, giving rise to the giant-kin
- Together, they made a frozen wasteland, home to all giants in Far Ran
- This, the dragons, did not appreciate, as their land was disturbed
- So the two races went into war
- This caught Annam's attention and he found out that Othea cheated on him
- Annam was to punish Othea but Utuliu exiled himself in replacement for her life
- When Annam commanded the giants cease this needless war, Othea disagreed, saying they must protect their own home -- to which the giants agreed
- Annam did not give up, and tried to have another son, but Othea found out and repressed the child
- Annam said he would exile himself if Othea allowed the child to be born
- With her dying breath, the child was born but his small stature meant he was rejected by the giants and did not aid him against the dragons
- So he died
- Soon the dragons left and the giants went into Ajysius or stayed in Far Ran
