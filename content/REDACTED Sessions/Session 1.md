### Ambush

In the auditorium, the old man rises and reveals himself to be Asmodeus. He will then try to scare everyone away from this mission. So he tells them them that each of the Fragments of the Fallen are guarded by one of my Avatars. 

I need the whole world to know this. And if you couldn't tell, I'm a little lazy. So I need a volunteer. Anyone? 

WHAT SKILLS CHALLENGE? COMBAT?
