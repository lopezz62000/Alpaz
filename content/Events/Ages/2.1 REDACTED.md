> The Far Realm launched its attack on Alpaz very early. The world was still in its infancy. The attack first landed on Linwa and the whole world saw it. However, Ao and Ouroboros stood by watching and waiting to see if a world in its infancy could come up with a way to fight back against the Far Realm. Afterall, only now has this occurred. 
> 
> Ahriman saw an issue with all this. They believed that this was a terrible sign that the far realm was beginning to find their worlds at a pace faster than they can create them. Soon, their time of experimentation will come to an end. They had to do something.
> 
> Ahriman intervened. With the same powers they used to create the crystal sphere, Ahriman blocked off the continent of Linwa from the other continents. Ao was disappointed by Ahriman's actions, suggesting that this would make the experiment moot. Ouroboros proposed a solution: let the people of Linwa face the far realm and wipe the memories of the citizens of Gul and Nol. In this way, Alpaz would turn into two valid experiments. Ao and, reluctantly, Ahriman agreed.
> 
> They hoped for something different, but Linwa was destroyed. Its people put up a fight, but there was no winning. Before the creatures of the Far Realm could break into the other continents, Ao destroyed the continent.
