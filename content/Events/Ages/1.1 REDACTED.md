>After the creation, the overdeities sent their aspects into the world. Ahriman sent Asmodeus to fall from the skies and be a constant threat to everyone, forcing the denizens of Alpaz to grow and face even stronger threats. Ouroboros sent Jazirian and many other aspects to be of influence to many different cultures of Alpaz, helping them find new and unique solutions to the problems they face. Finally, Ao sent a portion of themself to be an observer and an absent manager to the deities.
