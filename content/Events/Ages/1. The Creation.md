It is widely believed that the universe in which Alpaz resides was created by three overdeities: Ao, Jazirian, and Ahriman. Ao, the overdeity of divine power, created the deities as channels of Ao's power. Jazirian, the overdeity of primal power, created the physical matter of all the planes with which beings can use Jazirian's power. Finally, Ahriman, the overdeity of arcane power, enclosed everything in a crystal sphere and split it into different realms and dimensions, adding order to the chaos and making it easier for beings to understand and make use of Ahriman's power. Together, they created the world we now know as Alpaz. 

As for its inhabitants, each of the overdeities brought their to Alpaz. Ao allowed its deities to create sentient life in the outer plane. Jazirian breathed life into the inner planes, allowing souls to find their way into any part of the existing landscape. This created the primordials, Ahriman brought already existing life from a dying universe and allowed them to manipulate newborn life on Alpaz. 

Together, with varying degrees of help from the other inhabitants of Alpaz, they created the races of the material plane. The races with heavy influence from Ao lived on the continent of Nol. The races with heavy influence from Jazirian lived on the continent of Gul. The races with heavy influence from Ahriman lived in the unoccupied spaces between.
