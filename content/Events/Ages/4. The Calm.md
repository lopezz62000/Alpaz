For a hundred years since the war and fifty years since the breaking of the barrier, the world continued in relative calm.

Of course, the world still had its wrinkles. There were sudden invasions of devils and demons, fluctuations in levels of randomness, explosions in the entertainment industry, appearances of wild magic pockets, reappearances of dragons, and many more happenings. However, none of them ever turned into something devastating.

All happenings have been kept under wraps by [[Race United]]. However, the public believes that a single group was responsible for the current calm in the world: [[The Kaeto Party]]. There is but one picture of the whole group believed to be taken a couple of days after its formation during the demon invasion of [[Neoland]] in [[Faycub Metropolis]].

Where are they now? Some of its members still roam Alpaz, but most of them do not speak of any past happenings. Those that do tell stories of a grand adventure, of places and people. we could not even comprehend. Is it the truth? The world will never know. 

Still, the people of Alpaz sit in comfort knowing that there are people that protect the world from things we do not know of and of things we do not know that we do not know.
