There was a time when all deities could do as they please. However, when Ao returned during [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]] and learned all that had happened, Ao was not pleased. The deities had done nothing to keep the world balanced. 

So Ao changed their function. Each deity gained a portfolio and an alignment. No deity had the same combination of portfolio and alignment. Each deity's powers can only affect things within their portfolio and alignment. Making use of such abilities requires divine sparks.

For every action performed by an individual from the race of the prime material plane, it is also assigned a portfolio and alignment. The deity who has that combination gains a divine spark. In addition, an individual from the race of the prime material plane who becomes a devotee of that deity gains a divine ember which produces divine sparks. In this way, each of the deities must use their power to encourage people to perform actions related to their portfolio and alignment.

The death of a deity results in a couple of things. The divine embers of that deity are released from their body and can be collected by anyone. The divine sparks are split amongst the remaining deities of that alignment. Finally the portfolio is given to a new deity or an existing one of that alignment.
