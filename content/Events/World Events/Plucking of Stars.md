Age: "[[1. The Creation|The Creation]]"

Some time towards the end [[1. The Creation|The Creation]], astronomers among the newborn country of [[Ajysius]] discovered that the stars have been disappearing. They were not until they saw it happen in real time on the day of Celestial Alignment. Every year since, when the Celestial Alignment occurs, some of the stars in the sky would disappear. None have figured out why.

However, given that some of the stars in the sky are actually the domains of some deities, many believe that it is because of the Plucking of Stars that deities like Corellon and Psilofyr have suddenly disappeared. In addition, given that the material that made up the invisible barrier that caused [[2. The Division|The Division]] is the same as the material that makes up the crystals sphere, it is believed that the reason for the sudden disappearance of the invisible barrier is the same reasons as the Plucking of Stars.
