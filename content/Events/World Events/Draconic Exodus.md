Age: "[[2. The Division|The Division]]"
---
Believed to be created when the three overdeities were in perfect harmony, the dragons were a mighty race. They were the rulers of the mountains and the skies. Some served as protectors of many lands and, to others, their destroyers. Despite their many different draconic types, the single thing that unified them was their pursuit of gold. It is unknown exactly why they would hoard gold. It is, however, believed to be the reason for why there are no more dragons on Alpaz.

During [[2. The Division|The Division]], dragons began to leave the prime material plane. According to the Dragon Mother, the dragons were called to a sort of promised land by Asgorath, the deity of all the dragons. Although the Dragon Mother was unsure as to why, she did allude to the promised land being a land filled with gold. For this reason, the majority of people believe that Asgorath commanded all of dragon command to complete one final task in order to receive that which they truly sought after.

Some dragons, though very few, did stay in Alpaz.
