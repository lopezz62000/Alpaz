Lumiseth fell very ill on the day [[2. The Division|The Division]] began. When he returned to consciousness, he manifested the powers of a Zekyll – a half-drow, half dragonborn – or at least what they assumed it to be. With this power, Lumiseth fought back against the spread of fiends from open portals to the [[Blood War]].

With his power, he convinced the people of [[Throldyar]] to take up arms and find the rest of the [[elemental weapons]] for him. In the process, he promised them dominion over the countries of Gul. And so they did.

Only when [[The Agents of Chaos]] formed and took a stand against him did his campaign come to an end.
