Lumiseth fell very ill on the day [[2. The Division|The Division]] began. When he returned to consciousness, he manifested the powers of a Zekyll – a half-drow, half dragonborn – or at least what they assumed it to be. With this power, Lumiseth quickly contained the spread of the fire elementals and found the elemental weapon of fire. 

With his power, he convinced the people of Throldyar to take up arms and find the rest of the [[elemental weapons]] for him. In the process, he promised them dominion over the countries of Gul. And so they did.

Only when [[The Agents of Chaos]] formed and took a stand against him did his campaign come to an end.
