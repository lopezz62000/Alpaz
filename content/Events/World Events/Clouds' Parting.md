Age: "[[1. The Creation|The Creation]]"

The world's seas were once covered in dense clouds. By the time anyone was a hundred kilometers out from the shore, the seas were complete darkness. Myths spoke of monstrous creatures in the darkness, sounds of creatures from the sea and flashes of creatures from the clouds above. Not only that, but the clouds themselves crept closer and closer to land. 

However, when the people of [[Boarstost City]] in [[Eitur]] built the first boats, brave men took to the seas. At first, many did not return. However, in time, they learned that the clouds had a strange property: the exposure of the clouds to [[Solen crystals]] caused them to part. Even from just the surface of the water, repeated exposure to [[Solen crystals]] could cause the clouds to thin and slowly disappear. 

Soon enough, people from all over the world took to the seas and and clouds were parted permanently.
