The would-be adventurers of the world have received an invitation â€“ to go on a mission to obtain the powers of the devil. And so, a group of 6 adventurers meet at the God-Struck Tree located at the northernmost point of [[Far Ran]], west north-west of the outpost in [[Silent Riddle Plains]].

After reading the new instructions on their invitation and jumping off of an invisible cliff in a portal, the party finds themselves in one of the [[Void Space Legion|VSL]] hideouts. After registering with a scarlet dragonborn named Arentha, the party splits to explore the hideout. 

Grog goes to the armory, helping a blacksmith symic hybrid unpack an iron box of special items, receiving a shield trinket in return.

Valta and Birdo grab some food in the cafeteria. Valta talks to a ranger named David who tests him on his ranger skills. He fails, but he learns that perhaps this is all just a suicide mission organized by the [[Void Space Legion|VSL]]. Birdo on the other hand joins a group of dwarves, playing a game of potion panic. Birdo participates, winning and receiving a potion of healing.

Playgia, Thonk, and Zofrith go to the library. Thonk goes to "read" a coloring book, which Playgia realizes is a spell scroll. They all talk to an elven father with a tiefling child and to an old man with what appears to be a transmuted rod. The two men don't provide much information, especially the old man who mentions that he has lost a child and refuses to elaborate, saying "Be careful what questions you ask, because the answers may get you killed."

Soon after, they are called to the auditorium where [[Daemyar]] explains the details of their mission and how they need to search for and retrieve the Fragments of the Fallen, the parts of Ahriman, the overdeity. However, the meeting is interrupted by the old man who reveals himself to be Asmodeus, the deity that Ahriman has now become.
