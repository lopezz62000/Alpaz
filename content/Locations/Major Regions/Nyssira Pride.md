Country: "[[Throldyar]]"
Pro: "A sanctuary to the broken, Nyssirite people help nurture a new hope in peopleâ€™s lives"
Con: "The desperate may find hope in other ways here due to the activity of malicious powers in the place"
Quirk: "A fog covers much of the city and is quite heavy during dawn and dusk. Many say voices of those who were lost in the war again Lumiseth could be heard in it"

The country's landscape is depressing; drying rivers and springs as well as forgotten buildings are just a sliver of the aridity Nyssira has to offer. However, the city is home to highest number of temples in the country of [[Throldyar]]. Where the rest of the country focuses on the power of the arcane and primal, the Nyssirite Dragonborn focus on the divine. 

The city used to be a safehaven for those who stood against the rise of Lumiseth, the dark flame zekyll who plunged all of Gul into darkness. However, as the age of [[2. The Division|The Division]] continues, the connection of the clerics to divine waned and the protection of the city from the growing army of Lumiseth weakened. Soon, the citizens of Nyssira were no more.

After [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]], clerics and holy peoples from all over Alpaz found an unusual connection to the divine here. As a result, new temples were raised, reinvigorating the city with the holy blood that once flowed through its drying veins.
