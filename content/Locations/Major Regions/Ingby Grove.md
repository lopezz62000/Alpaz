Since the dawn of time, Ingby city was inhabited only by the Yieldans, large lumbering tree-people native to [[Dreamsprout]]. Every day was filled with festivities and extravagant celebrations that would have been dangerous for any creatures smaller than them. But this changed after [[3. The Great Unification|the Great Unification]].

One day, a nomadic group of thrill-seeking Tabaxi found Ingby city. Seeing how they were lost and weary from their journey, the Yieldans welcomed them with open arms, offering them food and shelter. Once the dayâ€™s celebrations began, the Yieldans gave the Tabaxi a chance to leave knowing the danger they posed to the group. However, the Tabaxi were curious and confident in their abilities, so they decided to stay. True enough, the Tabaxi were able to live through the event and even enjoy the festivity. Amazed by the beauty of the forest, they decided to make it their home.

As more and more travelers arrived in the forest, they began to build homes and shops among the trees, gradually transforming the forest into a bustling city. The Yieldans watched as the city grew around them, fascinated by the small creatures who scurried about in their midst.

At first, the Yieldans were wary of the newcomers, but they soon grew to appreciate their company. They enjoyed listening to their stories and sharing their festivities with them.

Over time, the city of Ingby grew into a thriving community, with the Tabaxi playing an important role in its development. The Yieldans provided the city with wood for building and taught the newcomers how to live in harmony with the forest through their celebrations.
