Quirk: Myconid taste color so the trash is sorted into colorful mounds before being consumed by creatures of the same color

Ydmry serves as the homeland to many Myconid. After coming to life in Drusea, suffocated out of Ylanta, the Myconid finally settled in the marshes of this city. In exchange for their decision to leave Ylanta, the Poaceries of Drusea and Yeildings of Ingby would send their excess resources to Ydmry â€” along with their wastes. 

With their incredible ability to consume and break down organic matter, the Myconids set to work, transforming the decaying city into a thriving, putrid metropolis. They created vast underground networks of tunnels and caverns, where they could raise their young. Over time, the Myconids developed a symbiotic relationship with the waste, using it to fuel their growth and feed their people.

As the years passed, the place became a life-filled wasteland. The Myconids had created a unique ecosystem that sustained them and provided a valuable service to the rest of [[Dreamsprout]]. The city was now a thriving hub for waste disposal, and people from all over the country would come to visit and marvel at the Myconids' incredible ability to turn waste into life.
