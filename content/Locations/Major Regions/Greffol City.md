The city of Greffol, the capital of [[Eitur]], has been around since [[1. The Creation|The Creation]]. In the past, Greffol was known as the last guard against the evils of the world of magic. Legends tell of the brave King of [[Eitur]] who was responsible for closing off the portals between the world of magic and the world of technology and who sought to guard it til the end of his life. However, he and his wife were killed. It is believed that the attach was started by creatures from Gul who were unable to return home before [[2. The Division|The Division]] but nothing is certain. 

Greffol was abandoned for a long time and many creatures found a home in the forests surrounding the city. Small towns still existed, but not enough to require governance. However, it is believed that it is in the city of Greffol that half of the members of [[The Agents of Chaos]] first met. Without much of a military, it was here that both Nologites and Gulians were able to establish a relationships. Soon enough, they returned to Greffol to open the portal and start [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]]. 

Today, Greffol remains largely unaltered in its beautiful architecture. The forests surrounding it are still filled with an assortment of magical creatures. It is said that the kindest of them all make their home in Greffol and may even bless those who are lucky enough to stumble upon them. Among all the cities of [[Eitur]], it is Greffol that is lacking the most in modernity in technology. However, as the home of bravery and unification, the people of [[Eitur]] are proud to call it their capital.
