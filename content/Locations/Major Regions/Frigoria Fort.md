Long ago, Frigoria was a thriving metropolis in the heart of [[Zerathin]], known for its bustling marketplaces and its grand temples dedicated to the gods. The city was a hub of trade, with merchants from all over Alpaz coming to Frigoria to buy and sell goods.However, portals to the plane of fire opened and, from them, emerged a horde of fire elementals, wreaking havoc and destruction upon the unsuspecting citizens of Frigoria. The fire elementals burned everything in their path, reducing buildings to ashes and leaving the city in ruins.

In the aftermath of the attack, the survivors tried to rebuild their city, but the portals to the Plane of Fire continued to open sporadically, causing further destruction and chaos. Eventually, the remaining citizens of Frigoria decided to abandon the city and move to safer locations, leaving the once-great metropolis to fall into ruin.

Today, Frigoria is simply an extension of the plane of fire. It is a home to the fire elementals with floating chunks of magma and rivers of lava. The city is a destination for thrill-seekers and adventurers, a place where they can test their skills and prove their bravery. The [[Race United]] have tried to convert it into another training camp like [[Worskan Pride]], but even they deemed it far too dangerous. Only the [[Void Space Legion]] venture here, seeking secrets not from the dead like in [[Zofrika Pride]] but from the oxygen-consuming fire elementals.
