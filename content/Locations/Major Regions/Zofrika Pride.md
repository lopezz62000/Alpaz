Zofrika is beyond repair. Fractured to the bone by the war between the Tieflings and Dragonborn during [[2. The Division|The Division]], there is nothing to see here except the constantly decaying bodies of the two armies. Cursed both by blood magic and forbidden zekyl magic, the land is home only to wild dark magic. The only people who veture here are crazed researchers from [[Siaga]] and the mysterious scouts of the [[Void Space Legion]]. What they have uncovered, if anything, is unknown to all.
