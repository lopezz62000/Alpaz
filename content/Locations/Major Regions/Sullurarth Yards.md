  - City
Country: "[[Qroaz]]"
Pro: Rare items of all sorts found in the city
Con: The price of items are not gold, so you better have something the Lizardfolk like in exchange for their valuable items
Quirk: The basilisk that serves as the Usrak is actually not dead, but is only petriefied by its own gaze (which it has escaped in the past, allowing it to move)

Sullurarth is known for its poor economy, which is kind of ironic since it is the closest city to Faycub Metropolis. It is mainly supported by leatherworking, carpenting and armorsmithing. The materials used to make their crafts are rare, and the turn out is high quality. Despite this, Lizardfolk are just not the best at marketting. Hence, Sullurath has never really prospered. 

The Usrak of Sullurarth city is that of a basilisk.
