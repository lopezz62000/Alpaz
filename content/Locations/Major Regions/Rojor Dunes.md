Rojor, the capital of [[Ajysius]], is a place of wild magic and ancient secrets. It is the city that is most difficult to find among the major cities of [[Ajysius]]. Considered the capital of Rojor, the city is known to be the first Firbolg city established in the country.

According to the fables of the Firbolg, Rojor used to be a city of the Fey. For this reason, it was avoided by the giants. Seeking refuge from the destructive nature of their kin, the Firbolg decided to study the Fey and learn their ways. Once they bypassed their trickery, the Firbolg were able to live in coexistence with the Fey. It is believed that it is because of this relationship that the Firbolg found their odd ability to turn invisible.

Regardless of the true nature of this fable, the Firbolg found a safe haven in the region and established a settlement. As time passed, the Firbolg grew in population and the settlement became a city. With great care and possibly some access to wild magic or fey magic, vast groves and greenery appeared in the middle of the [[Thiashen desert]]. 

To this day, people believe that the Firbolg of Rojor have access to the most ancient of magic. Many come to seek their wisdom. Few have seen it, and fewer yet have returned.
