Pro: "An abundance of gems and crystals and quests for adventurers"
Con: "Quest’s danger levels are often underplayed to lower rewards and entice more adventurers"

Cos Xoc city lays nestled north of the [[Rosemond hills]] and surrounded by [[Scratch Rock range]]. The combination made it an ideal location for miners to test their luck and grab precious gems. Despite its inhospitable environment, Cos Xoc boasts the highest rate of rare gem production per year in all of Alpaz.

The city's progress was, however, not without its own set of challenges. Despite the abundance of gems, miners often had to brave the dangerous conditions of the mountain range to get them. The city was also beset by other threats, including the presence of criminals and unscrupulous business owners, as well as a lack of resources.

But the citizens of Cos Xoc were determined to overcome these obstacles and make their city prosperous. Hence, the Cosxocs decided to spend some money to make some money. More specifically, they hired bands of adventurers to deal with all their problems, promising the precious gems in their mines as a reward (as well as any lost treasures they found). Soon enough, there were no more iron golems in the mines or criminal organizations running underfoot. All that was left was for humans to continue with their flourishing business. 

During [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]], Cosxocs learned the importance of precious gems in spellcasting and magic item creation. Furthermore, with the establishment of [[Siaga]], metals also became important in [[Eitur]]. Hence, the Cosxocs went to work, mining away their days. There are still troubles that reappear in the city, but nothing that a few adventurers can’t handle.
