During [[1. The Creation|The Creation]], Ryliedo was a bustling city, full of life and magic. The streets were lined with colorful buildings and the sound of laughter and music filled the air. It was a place where people from all over Gul came to visit. Despite its old location being far inland, it was home to many water-bourne Onodrim. To survive, they simply used magic to create pockets of water all over, creating highways for them to travel.

But as time passed and the magic of the Onodrim diminished with the death of their deity, Psilofyr, these Onodrim lost their ability to live inland. The people of Ryliedo made a difficult decision: they would abandon the city and start anew elsewhere. They searched for a location that would allow them to live in harmony with the natural world, where the Onodrim and other creatures could coexist without the need for magic.

They eventually found a spot on the outskirts of the city, a quiet stretch of beach where the sand was whiter and the water clearer than anywhere else in [[Dreamsprout]]. Here, they built a new Ryliedo, a place where nature was given the space it needed to thrive. The new Ryliedo was not a city in the traditional sense, but rather a community of people who valued the simple pleasures of life: a good meal, a quiet walk along the beach, and a warm fire to gather around in the evening.

After [[3. The Great Unification|the Great Unification]], the people of Ryliedo began to attract like-minded individuals from all over Alpaz. They built small businesses and souvenir shops to cater to visitors, but they did so in a way that respected the natural beauty of their surroundings. And so, Ryliedo became known as a haven for those seeking a peaceful retreat, a place where the stresses of everyday life could be left behind.
