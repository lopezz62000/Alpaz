Dugant city is a sight to behold. Bars, virtual arcades, and floating discos are all crammed together in the city, and the dancing lights never seem to end. It may just be the large neon lights that scatter the place, providing a unique ambiance that is both modern and nostalgic, but there is no difference between night-life and day-life here.

Where the rest of [[Eitur]] aside from [[Tafarn City]] focused on how to protect the portal during [[2. The Division|The Division]], Dugant focused on making the best of life. Hence, all new technologies that came out of the city were all for the fun of its citizens and the rest of [[Eitur]]. 

After [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]], the city became a melting pot of cultures, with people from all over the world coming together to create a vibrant, diverse atmosphere. The city was full of life and energy, and everyone seemed to be a part of the action. There is always an opening here for any entertainers and more so for entertainees.
