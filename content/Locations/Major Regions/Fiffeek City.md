The [[Siaga]] HQ is in Fiffeek city. It is here that [[Tranquil Snow]] did most of their work, isolated from any other cities so as to protect them from possible accidents. It was also close enough to regions with resources important to their work. When [[Tranquil Snow]] was assassinated, the people of Fiffeek tried to continue their work with what little they gleamed from conversations with the inventor. Once the portals opened with the help of their inventions, their work was done. Still, the people of Fiffeek were not finished and their brand of technology would continue to spread. They created new inventions to give back to those who supported the great inventor and the city in the past years. 

As news of the city and its inventions spread, people from all over the world began to travel to the city. Scholars, entrepreneurs, and even adventurers were drawn to the promise of progress and opportunity that the city held. As the city grew and its inventions spread, the people of Fiffeek found themselves with a newfound sense of belonging and purpose. Soon, with enough interest, the people of Fiffeek were able to build [[Siaga]] and honor the work by the late inventor.

Today, the greatest minds of Elves, Dwarves, Humans, even Vedalken are here. It is home to frequent explosions whose colorful lights could be seen from the neighboring major cities.
