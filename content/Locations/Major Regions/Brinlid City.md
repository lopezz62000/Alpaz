The beautiful city of Brinlid, located in the country of [[Eitur]], was home to humans led by Lord Gedman. The city is a sight to behold, with its mahogany wood rooftops, granite walls, and rows of lush trees. The main attraction of Brinlid is the water mill, around which the city was built around 36SY years ago.

Recently, it has become public knowledge that that power plant was actually established by werewolves and other creatures that were native to Gul. The reason was that they were trapped in Nol during [[2. The Division|The Division]] and were persecuted everywhere else. Many of them had investigated the portal south of [[Eitur]] but it was locked using powerful technologies. To develop their own devices, the creatures had to learn engineering â€” for which they needed electricity. Hence, the water mill was created.

It is unknown if the project was abandoned or if the creatures were hunted down by the Eiturians. Still, the water mill was discovered by a nomadic tribe of humans and Brinlid was established around it. Today, the mill has been upgraded into a hydro electric plant, supplying electricity to all of [[Eitur]] and some places beyond. The fates of the Gulian creatures remain unknown although some suggest that they have learned to cohabitate with the humans of Brinlid or moved to [[Boarstost City]] with the elementals or to [[Greffol City]] with the other Gulians.
