Faycub city is the capital of [[Neoland]]. The city is home to many merchants. Most of the shops found in the city specialize in the sale of common adventuring goods such as weapons, armor, potions, magic items, artisanâ€™s tools and the like. The main purveyor of these goods is Himrun mart which can be found in almost any city and even the outposts of [[Far Ran]]. 

Faycub is also home to [[Leafwalker Industries]] headquarters. Established by Fastrada Leafwalker some time after the discovery of the island, the establishment is responsible for new business openings, arranging deals, and monitoring the supply of goods across the world. With the passing of Fastrada, Aura Osorin rose to the position. Although previously unknown, it is said that she blackmailed her way to the top because she knew of some underground businesses that Fastrada and other powerful merchants were doing in order to maintain their wealth. Still, with the transfer of power, business seems to be booming and there is no one left unsupplied or unemployed on the island of Faycub.
