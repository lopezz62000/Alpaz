During [[1. The Creation|The Creation]], a curse fell upon the lush and beautiful land of Mith Rali. The skies turned dark, and a thick fog descended upon Mith Rali. The crops withered and died, and the forests became overgrown and tangled. The rivers and ponds turned stagnant and foul-smelling, and disease swept through the land.

The people of Mith Rali tried everything they could to lift the curse. They prayed to their deities and made offerings at their shrines, but nothing worked. Desperate for a solution, they turned to a group of powerful wizards who lived in a distant city.

The wizards came to Mith Rali and examined the land. They discovered that the curse had been brought about by a terrible act of greed and cruelty committed by the former ruler of Mith Rali. The ruler had grown jealous of his neighbors' wealth and power, and he had made a dark pact with a demon to gain the upper hand.

The wizards knew that breaking the curse would require a great sacrifice: blood for blood. They would have to confront the demon and defeat it in battle. But they also knew that they could not do it alone. They needed the help of the people of Mith Rali.

And so, the people of Mith Rali banded together with the wizards. The wizards taught them how to use blood as a source of magical power. Soon, they set out to face the demon. The battle was long and grueling, but in the end, the people of Mith Rali emerged victorious.

The curse was lifted, and the land began to heal. But the scars of the curse remained. The fields and forests had become overgrown and chaotic, and the ponds and rivers had turned foul. The people of Mith Rali worked hard to reclaim their land, but they knew that it would never be as it was before.

To this day, Mith Rali remains a land of unsightly landscapes and smelly ponds. But the people of Mith Rali are proud of their resilience and their willingness to welcome outsiders. They know that they may never have the beauty and prosperity of their neighbors, but they are content in their own way.
