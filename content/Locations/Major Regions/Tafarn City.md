Tafarn is what people call "The Okay City." It's an urban city with nothing of note. That is to say it has nothing that makes it as special as the other city in [[Eitur]]. However, it does offer mediocre resources of what nearby cities have amazing qualities of. For example, it has some metals, some ship building, and some entertainment services. However, unlike Cos Cox, Boarstost, and Dugant, Tafarn is not known for these things. Instead, it is known for its cheaper prices to make up for the lower quality products.

For this reason, Tafarn city has still expanded into a major city. Over the years, it has lost more of its scenic charm to make way for more buildings and highways that can handle the need for increased volume of production. However, its people are happy living a normal life where nothing extravagant happens â€” at least not often enough to note.
