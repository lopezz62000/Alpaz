Skachar was formed to supplement the infrastructure, technology, and manpower needed by [[Yorayi Fort]] in the war against Lumiseth. Although the war is no more and its infrastructure has just been abandoned, tieflings still live here.

They repurposed the city's crumbling infrastructure, using their skills as architects and engineers to create homes. They also preserved tiefling culture in the city, with ritual performances and exotic art filling the streets.

Today, Skachar is a thriving city, a place where the Tieflings can remember their past and be relieved. The blood pools and grim sights of the city serve as a reminder of the horrors they have faced, but also of their resilience and strength. The city is a testament to the power of community and the ability of people to come together in the face of adversity.
