Jhogre is the capital of [[Qroaz]] simply because the tribe is known to be the strongest tribe in the country. Holding the title of captial has no significance to the rest of the Lizardfolk. It is believed that the tribe have secret methods of hunting, allowing them to take down ancient dragons when they were still arround.  The tribes located in [[Retestrirt Yards]] and [[Tov Yards]] to the north don't date come near the coast line when they know that the Jhogran lizardfolk are fishing.

The Usrak of the city is that of an ancient dragon. However, the dragon was reincarnated and is now lost.
