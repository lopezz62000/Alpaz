The landscape of Gernrom City was somewhat of a sight to behold. Steep, sinister mountains towered over the city, and an ash spewing volcano only added to the bleakness of the city. It was no wonder why Gernrom was shirked among foreigners. 

What many do not know is that Gernrom is home to many rare metals. The Gernrom Dwarves have specialized in metalsmithing and used the rare metals to their advantage. They rarely sell them, and even more rarely let other people enter their mines. However, with a high enough price they are willing to give their precious jewels away. 

It is believed that there are still metals within their mines that none except the Gernrom Dwarves have seen, although they none know what price they would need to pay to see them.
