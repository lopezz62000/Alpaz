During [[1. The Creation|The Creation]], the Dragonborn, who had recently arrived in the continent of Gul, settled in the area now known as Yorayi. As they began to build their homes and communities in the area, they discovered that the land was rich in natural resources, particularly copper and silver. Over time, the Dragonborn became skilled at mining, and their city grew in prosperity and power. However, they soon realized that they needed the help of other races to truly thrive.

Enter the Tieflings. Though initially wary of the Dragonborn, the Tieflings were drawn to the land of Yorayi and its abundant resources. They saw an opportunity to create a new culture, one that blended the strength of the Dragonborn with the creativity and ingenuity of their own race. Together, the Dragonborn and Tieflings built a city that was unlike any other in the world of Alpaz, a true mix of two cultures. 

However, during [[2. The Division|The Division]] and the rise of Lumiseth, the dragonborn planned to first take over Yorayi fort due to its significant resources. However, the Blood Circle was prepared, having learned of the use of blood magic from [[Ozmarin Fort|Ozmarin]] and [[Mith Rali Fort|Mith Rali]], they were ready to take on the power of the zekyl king. They developed infrastructure and technologies to channel blood magic, even building [[Skachar Fort]] to supplement their military and magical needs. Although a constant battleground, Yorayi Fort never fell. 

When [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]] finally occured, the need for blood magic diminished and the infrastructure used for it was repurposed. The blood pools of the Tieflings were repurposed as geothermal power plants. The blood veins used to harness wind energy. And so it became easy for Yorayi to become a hub of modern technology in Gul, land of magic.
