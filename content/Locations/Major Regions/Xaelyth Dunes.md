When the Firbolg population was too big for Rojor city, many Firbolg tribes went back to their nomadic roots, roaming the desert in search of a new home. Unfortunately, many of these tribes were hunted down by monsters roaming the banks of the [[Rainpath River]].

As they traveled through the desert, the Firbolg stumbled upon a strange and unfamiliar land. The sandstorms were fierce, the rivers treacherous, and the seas unforgiving. But despite the challenges, the Firbolg saw potential in this new land. They believed that with hard work and determination, they could turn it into a thriving city.

They set about building Xaelyth, their new home, using the techniques they had learned over generations of wandering the desert. They crafted homes from sandstone and clay, dug wells for water, and used their hunting and gathering skills to feed themselves.

As time passed, the Firbolg of Xaelyth became known for their exceptional trading skills. They were the only major city in [[Ajysius]] that traded with other countries, and they quickly became the economic powerhouse of the region. They traded spices, silk, and precious stones with the neighboring kingdoms, bringing wealth and prosperity to Xaelyth.

But their success did not come without struggle. The harsh environment of their land continued to pose challenges, and the Firbolg had to adapt to survive. They developed advanced techniques for harvesting water, using windmills and cisterns to capture rain and underground streams.
