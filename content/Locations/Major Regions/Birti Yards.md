Birti's landscape is quite frightening; dreary hills, decaying forests and black lakes are just a sliver of the desolation Birti has to offer. Even members of the [[Void Space Legion]] avoid this area. Moreover, The Lizardfolk of Birti are unpleasant towards foreigners as they feel foreigners could cripple the cityâ€™s well being. Outside of that, its citizens are known to be the best fishermen in Alpaz, able to catch large amounts of fish nothing but a spear.

The Usrak of Birti city is that of an unknown creature, believed to be from the depths of the ocean.
