Once a small fishing village, Northhaven was known for its abundance of fresh seafood that was caught by local fishermen and sold to nearby cities. Its population was a mix of the many races of Gul, a rarity before [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]]. It is said that they all simply shared the love of fishing. The last to arrive were the Vedalken.

At first, the Vedalken kept to themselves, studying the local flora and fauna. But as they grew more curious about the village and its people, they began to interact with the fishermen and their families. Over time, the Vedalken shared their knowledge of magic and technology with the locals, and the two groups began to work together.

The fishermen learned how to use magic to better navigate the sea, while the Vedalken learned about the local marine life and how to cultivate it for food. As their cooperation deepened, the village transformed into a bustling fishing city and port.

Today, the city is run by Vedalken who have established research facilities in the city, attracting scientists and researchers from all over Alpaz. They also built factories to produce new technologies and set up schools to improve the fishing industry. Still, the people of Northhaven remained humble and hardworking. They continued to fish, and their catches were sent to other cities across Gul and Nol. The city's cobblestone streets and modest homes were a testament to the community's focus on collaboration and progress, rather than greed and materialism.
