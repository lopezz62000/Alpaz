Lagav had always been a city of artifice, a place where the Vedalken's advanced knowledge of magic and technology had allowed them to create wondrous machines and constructs. For years, the city had been at the forefront of the Warforged production, creating countless numbers of the powerful robots that had helped the [[Race United]] gain a foothold in the world.

As time passed and [[4. The Calm|The Calm]] settled across the land, the need for large quantities of Warforged diminished. The industrious spirit of the Lagavites, however, did not waver. The factories producing Warforged redesigned their machines for more entertainment-centric purposes. The gears and machinery that had once built humanoid weapons were now used to create robotic performers and works of art. 

Soon enough, the lively nightlife that had always been a staple of Lagav grew ever vibrant, with music and laughter echoing through the streets late into the night. The city became known as a place of animatronic creativity and invention, where the fusion of magic and technology gave birth to a new generation of Warforged.
