Con: "Due to the lack of surveillance and the abundance of meat, it is common for camps to form unnoticed"

One of the most beautiful places in [[Kllurian]] is Beinrin, located by the Aerian rivers. The elves of [[Kllurian]] have taken it upon themselves to serve as caretakers here, protecting the many animals and fey creatures that call Beinrin home. Though they refuse to call it a zoo, they do ensure that the creatures remain tame, allowing tourists to safely enjoy their majestic beauty. Still, there are many regions that are off-limits to those who are not part of the Beinrin druid circle as many dangerous creatures continue to live untamed. 

Speaking of the Beinrin druid circle, these druids have made it their sacred duty to protect and care for the creatures of Beinrin. They have come up with a variety of methods to ensure that the creatures are treated with respect and kindness, from creating a system of laws to protect them to providing them with constant medical care. The druid circle has also enlisted the help of local rangers to continue to patrol the vast and diverse landscapes of the vale, removing any potential dangers and reporting any possible improvements to the habitat. 

Currently, there are many protests against the use of lands for farming certain animals. Not only is it a desecration of the land, but the farming practices also do not prioritize the well-being of the animals being farmed. The archdruids of the Beinrin circle and [[Leafwalker Industries]] continue to negotiate on this matter.
