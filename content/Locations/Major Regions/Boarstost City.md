A coastal city where the modern metal ships were born — that is Boarstost. The exact inventor is unknown, although it is rumored that it was [[Tranquil Snow]] themselves who created the exact schematics. It is believed that [[Tranquil Snow]] was always curious about the sea and what laid under the [[Clouds' Parting|clouds]]. They would walk the coast of Boarstost before they became an inventor, observing. There, they came up with the designs for vehicles that could traverse the water. True or not, there is record that the first modern ships were indeed deployed from the Boarstost harbor. 

Still, back in the day, there was not much to sea in the oceans east of Nol. After all, an invisible barrier prevented any travel between Nol and Gul during [[2. The Division|The Division]], and this included travel through water. However, sightings of otherworldly creatures were common in the waters at the edge of the world.

Given all this, the citizens of Boarstost decided to take their craft elsewhere, sharing their knowledge of modern ships to other nations. A large benefactor of this is Bretlyn city in [[Ilor]]. As time passed, many more designs, both stronger and more efficient were developed by Boarstost. Soon, many trade routes were established, a lot of them connecting Boarstost to other parts of the world. Furthermore, when the invisible barrier finally came down some time during the middle of [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]], it was these ships that truly allowed the first inter-dimensional relationships to be established. To this day, many still thank the unknown inventor for molding the Alpaz’s international trade and economy into what it is today.
