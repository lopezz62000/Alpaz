Long ago, Ozmarin was just a small village situated in the shadow of [[Mount Malexes]]. The villagers were mostly farmers and hunters, and life was simple and peaceful. When [[2. The Division|The Division]], the ground shook violently, and rocks and boulders tumbled down the mountainside, destroying homes and killing livestock. Amidst the chaos, a group of Tiefling sorcerers rose. Having sensed the fluctuations in magic even before [[2. The Division|The Division]] occured, they quickly realized that the magical energy that caused the cataclysm was emanating from a nearby gate, which connected the world of Gul to the neighboring world of Nol.

The sorcerers knew that they had to act fast. They used their magic to create a powerful shield around Ozmarin, protecting it from the worst of the destruction. They then set to work, using their powers to close the gate and prevent any further damage to their city. However, their magic was not enough. To supplement it, they had to use cursed blood magic to complete the mythal. Sure enough, the city was saved but not without their life-ending sacrifice.

Over time, Ozmarin became known as a hub of magical knowledge and expertise. The sorcerers who had saved the village became revered as heroes, and Tieflings who were interested in the arcane arts flocked to the area. In honor of their heroes, the Ozmarin tieflings built the Bloodtower. It is a magnificent structure that overlooked the gate and served as a symbol of their hero's sacrifice. It is also provides some protection from the effects of using blood magic, allowing people to study it here and find ways to minimize the damage it deals to oneself.

Today, Ozmarin is a bustling city, known for its stunning architecture, rich culture, and vibrant magical community. The Bloodtower still stands tall, a reminder of the heroism and bravery of the Tiefling sorcerers who saved the city from destruction. And although the memory of [[2. The Division|The Division]] is still painful, the people of Ozmarin continue to thrive, using their magic to create a better future for themselves and their world.
