Adronai City is renowned as the Armory of [[Kllurian]]. It was established at the foot of the Scratch Rock mountain range, starting as a small mining settlement. Knowing the importance of metals for weaponry, the drow, orcs, and goblins frequently raided the city. The local government erected walls and a garrison, yet the maleficent parties would wait for outbound shipments of metals or incoming completed weaponry before attacking, rendering the garrison ill-equipped for combat. Thus, the elven High Council decided to station blacksmiths in the city so as to protect both the cityâ€™s resources and its people.

Soon, however, the city's mines ran out of ore. Excavating further was perilous. With conflict continuing and wild creatures unyielding, this was a critical problem. Despite scarce magical resources, the Golden Council agreed to send seven high mages to perform a Ritual of Myriad. After months, the elves of Adronai marveled at Ironwood trees around the city, replacing their mines. The blacksmiths returned, solidifying the Armory of [[Kllurian]].

During [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]], Adronai was a primary site of commerce and technology. They traded metals and imparted knowledge about blacksmithing and metallurgy to the world. Many inventors from [[Siaga]] visited Adronai to train in metalwork. The elves happily accepted other races as apprentices and official blacksmiths. Still, the elves were careful not to divulge specific information to such inventors, lest they risk the obsolescence of magic.

Today, Adronai is a symbol of strength in the elven kingdom. Its citizens are proud to call it home, many devoting their lives to blacksmithing and creating new weapons, armor, and tools. Much of the equipment used by [[Race United]] comes from its many blacksmithing families. In addition, it is able to sell much of its excess Ironbark to [[Leafwalker Industries]]. Unfortunately, it has attracted corrupt individuals and wild creatures, although the elves continue to protect their home.
