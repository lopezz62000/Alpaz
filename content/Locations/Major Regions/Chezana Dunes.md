Aside from its yew wood rooftops and huge majestic geysers, Chezana is known for Zephyr’s wizard tower. The tower is built from sandstone and a repository for all the knowledge Zephyr had accumulated in their many years of studying magic. The wizard filled his tower with countless books and tomes, each containing secrets and spells that no one else in Alpaz had ever seen.

At first, the Firbolg were hesitant to enter the wizard's tower. They feared that it was too dangerous, that the immense power contained within would overwhelm them. Even worse, they feared that their mere presence around the tower could cause its destruction.

However, as their magic grew, the Firbolg used their mystic arts to extract information from the tower. Their eyes widened at the sight of the countless books and scrolls contained within. They began to study, to learn, to add their own knowledge to the already vast collection. And as they did, they realized the need for a scribe in the current world of Alpaz – someone who can safeguard and pass down important piece of information.

As a result, the Firbolg established the [[Urifir Bookbasin]], housing the largest collection of historical and magical information in all of Alpaz. They became the guardians of the tower, builders of its nearby libraries, and keepers of historical and magical information in all of Alpaz.
