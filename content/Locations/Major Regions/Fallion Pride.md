The capital of [[Throldyar]], Fallion City, was named after Fallion, the husband of [[Xion Aalrac|Xion]], the first king of the country. [[Xion Aalrac|Xion]], knowing the importance of unity, established the [[Race United]] in the city to maintain peace and cooperation not only among the kingdoms but all the races within.

As the years passed, the [[Race United]] began to grow and thrive. The different races of Alpaz began to integrate and form a unified culture of mutual understanding and respect within the country. The city of Fallion was a shining example of the country's unity in diversity.

People from all over the kingdom began to flock to Fallion City, seeking a better life and opportunities for their families. Businesses, markets, and festivals began to spring up in the city, bringing life and joy to its citizens.
