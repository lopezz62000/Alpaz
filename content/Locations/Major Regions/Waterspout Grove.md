Waterspout is the capital of [[Dreamsprout]]. It is home to [[the Black Oak]], a giant tree about 500 feet tall, that serves as the castle of the Onodrim royalties. It houses the spirits of all previous monarchs who continuously serve [[Dreamsprout]] by providing wisdom and council to the current ruler. These previous monarchs are known as the Root Onodrim. 

[[The Black Oak]] is believed to be the home of Psilofyr, the deity of the Onodrim. As a deity, Psilofyr wanted nothing more than the continued survival and longevity of their people. It is believed that they have been keeping the earth elementals at bay since [[1. The Creation|The Creation]]. However, due to the increased use of magic by the Onodrim, a power which they derived mostly from Psilofyr, the deity was strained. What follows is a mystery to this day. Some say a powerful earth elemental took the deity’s life. Some say that in order to fully seal the passage of earth elementals into [[Dreamsprout]], Psilofyr had to use all the power they had left. There are many other theories, but the conclusion is the same: the great oak withered. It’s trunk blackened but continued to stand as [[the Black Oak]]. 

Most recently, Waterspout became the center of the earth elemental invasion. However, [[Sarkiar d'Poacery|Sarkiar]] was able to enter [[the Black Oak]] and complete the tests of the Root Onodrim. Since then, major revitalization has gone into the city. Myconids have helped clean out the dead bodies of the dead Onodrim. The Yieldans set up shelter for everyone. The d'Poacery have repaired much of the damage. Although minimally functional, [[the Black Oak]] still stands as a reminder that the Onodrim race will continue to live for a very long time.
