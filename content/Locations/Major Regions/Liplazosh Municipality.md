Liplazosh is known for having the best and the worst of [[Nhovell]]. It is known for having the largest Shooting Star resorts which are owned by the [[Meili Hue]]. However, it is also known for having the biggest underground drug market. The reason behind this is uncertain to this day.

### Two-Faced City

Once upon a time, Liplazosh was a small, unremarkable town. It had a few farms, a small market, and a single inn that provided lodgings for travelers passing through. It was a peaceful place, where people knew each other by name and everyone looked out for one another.

But all of that changed when [[Meili Hue]] arrived in Liplazosh. She was a woman of immense wealth and power, and she saw potential in the small town that others did not. She knew that with the right investment, Liplazosh could become a hub of luxury and decadence.

[[Meili Hue]] bought up land, and she built the Shooting Star hotel and resort. The hotel was extravagant, with every amenity that a guest could desire. People came from all over Alpaz to stay there, and soon, the hotel became the main attraction of Liplazosh.

But with the influx of wealthy tourists, the town also saw an increase in crime. [[Meili Hue]] had always been a woman of many secrets, and it was rumored that she had ties to the criminal underworld. Some whispered that she was involved in the production and distribution of illegal drugs.

As the years went by, the rumors grew louder. The underground drug market in Liplazosh flourished, with SheeLDs becoming one of the most popular drugs in Alpaz. The local authorities turned a blind eye, either out of fear of [[Meili Hue]] or out of greed for the profits that came with the drug trade.

And so, Liplazosh became known for having both the best and the worst of [[Nhovell]]. The Shooting Star hotel and resort remained a symbol of luxury and indulgence, while the underground drug market thrived in the shadows.

To this day, no one knows the true extent of [[Meili Hue]]'s involvement in the drug trade. Some say she died years ago, while others believe she still lives in Liplazosh, hidden away in the shadows. But one thing is certain: her legacy lives on in the town she transformed into a city of contrasts.

### City of Potentials

The situation in present-day Liplazosh is still one of contrasts, with the Shooting Star hotel and resort still attracting wealthy tourists from all over Alpaz. However, the underground drug market remains a prominent aspect of the city's culture, with SheeLDs still being widely distributed.

In terms of [[Siaga]]'s involvement, their philanthropic investments in education and healthcare have had some positive impact on the city, but they have also faced challenges in working with local authorities to combat the drug trade and other forms of crime.

The presence of [[Void Space Legion]]'s research facility adds another layer of complexity to the city's dynamics. The study of dark energy and its potential uses is a controversial topic, and some fear that the group's involvement could attract even more criminal elements to the city.

Overall, Liplazosh remains with luxury and decadence existing alongside crime and underground activity. The involvement of [[Siaga]] and [[Void Space Legion]] in the city is both a source of potential progress and a potential cause for concern, given the city's history and present-day challenges.
