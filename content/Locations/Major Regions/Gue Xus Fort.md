Gue Xus is the first place the tieflings settled into. It is quite odd that it has a portal leading to Nol when it is literally connected to it by land, albeit the odd biome separation. For this reason, it is believed that there was once a third continent in Alpaz where the devils hailed and from where the tieflings came into existence. It may explain the odd curse that brings down the mood of its people.

Regardless of its origin, Gue Xus houses a downtrodden atmosphere. People here are generally unlucky and melancholic. It repels opportunities, resulting in a stagnant life. Architecture is old though well maintained and every day is simple.

The only thing that has flourished in Gue Xus are monasteries. Monks of different monastic traditions are abundant here. During [[2. The Division|The Division]], these were tieflings who were also in charge of protecting the city from any possible intruders at the portal. However, by [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]], many others joined the monasteries here. 

With the establishment of the monasteries, the population of Gue Xus steadily grew. Still, most people did not want to stay here. Hence, many tieflings who gained the courage moved out, establishing the neighboring cities of [[Ozmarin Fort|Ozmarin]] and [[Vel Grea Fort|Vel Grea]]
