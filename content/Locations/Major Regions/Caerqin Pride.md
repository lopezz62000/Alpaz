Caerqrin looks quite ordinary for a magical world. With vast animal farms and cottages, one might think that this is a piece of land in the country of the Dragonborn was actually stolen from the [[Eitur]], the country of the humans. And they would be right. 

Legend has it that a former king of the humans, long before the [[2. The Division|The Division]], had once stolen an egg that was entrusted by the dragon deity, Bahamut, to the protection of the Dragonborn. With perverse magic, the egg was embedded into the land, unable to removed from the pedestal of galvorn that stuck out of the earth. The king was determined to raise the dragon as its own livestock and start a new venture in animal husbandry.

It is believed that the entirety of the Dragonborn race, blessed by the angered Bahamut, came to the rescue of the dragon egg. Though they could not remove the egg from its resting place without damaging it, they and the dragons they had recruited were able to tear the city off the coast of [[Eitur]] in a single night. In no time, they were able to move it to the coast of [[Throldyar]]. The egg and the city has since then stayed there. 

Nobody knows if the dragon egg is well as it has not hatched since. The dragonborn, however, were petty and sought further revenge. The ancestors of the Caeqrin Dragonborn vowed to do better at what the humans did. And so they worked tirelessly to perfect the art of animal farming. Their hardwork can be observed to this day in the city, even exporting many of their goods back to the humans.
