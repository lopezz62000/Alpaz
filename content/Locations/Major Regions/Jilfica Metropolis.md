Jilfrica is a delightful place. The halflings here have preserved their olden culture, creating a place filled with greenery, dancing, and cheerfulness. With its redwood rooftops, chiseled stone walls and babbling creeks, Jilfrica has a great atmosphere. The main attraction is the single emerald obelisk which is rumored to serve as a messenger between gods and the plane touched. 

The city is the place where many people go in order to relax and gain new inspiration. Merchants of [[Neoland]] frequent the city in order to find new business ventures, but the entertainers of [[Alight Entertainment]] also come here to rid themselves of artist blocks. Outside of that, there isnâ€™t really any other services available on the island.
