Long ago, when the Onodrim began to settle into their respective regions, the earth elementals found their way into [[Dreamsprout]] through their portals. Although slow, the elementals caused great destruction, decimating many cities. But there was one city that stood strong against the invading force: Barnemouth.

The city of Barnemouth was Enuxar, the grand wizard, and its protector, the Aplecor Knights, were led by [[Sarkiar d'Poacery|Sarkiar]] d’Poacery. She was advised by Enuxar that the only way to defeat the earth elementals was for the rightful heir to seat at the throne — the rightful heir being her. However, she had to pass the trials of [[the Black Oak]] which was deep in the territory of the earth elementals. [[Sarkiar d'Poacery|Sarkiar]] was reluctant, but the attack by the earth elementals led by an unknown force killed Enuxar, urging her to begin her quest. Still, she could not go at it alone. Luckily, she came across skilled adventurers, [[Aster Winterhurst]] and [[Elton Hilltople]], to aid her in her mission.

For days, [[Sarkiar d'Poacery|Sarkiar]], [[Aster Winterhurst]], and [[Elton Hilltople|Elton]] went through elemental territory while tracking down the one leading the earth elementals. Soon, they reached [[The Black Oak]]. After passing the trials of the Root Onodrim, she was presented with the Glaive of Immortality, an artifact that the elementals feared. As one last attempt, the unknown force which had been trailing them tries to snatch the artifact, but [[Aster Winterhurst]] grabs it first and [[Elton Hilltople|Elton]] finishes off the figure.  

From that day forward, Barnemouth flourished. The people of the city celebrated their victory and their prosperity grew. The city's northern coastline became a hub of trade, where people would come from far and wide to exchange trinkets and treasures. And although the earth elementals were still present, they never caused any harm to [[Dreamsprout]] or its people.
