Country: "[[Qroaz]]"
Pro: Giant creatures well-preserved over decades
Con: Once preserved by the Retestral lizardfolk, it becomes extremely difficult to bring the bodies back to life

Retestrirt is home to the best of the Embalmers. Embalmers are to [[Qroaz]] as construction workers are to the rest of the world. The most intricate buildings or preserved giant creatures are in the city. The place looks like a work of art with preserved purple worms connecting different carcasses, allowing for passageways between "buildings".

The Usrak of Retestrirt city is that of a purple worm.
