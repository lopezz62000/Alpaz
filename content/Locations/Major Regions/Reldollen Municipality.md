Reldollen was a peaceful city until a terrible drought swept through the land. The crops withered and died, and the people of Reldollen were left with little food and water. Panic set in, and the citizens began to turn on each other. Fingers were pointed, and blame was cast.

As the drought dragged on, the people of Reldollen began to close themselves off from the outside world. They became increasingly insular, viewing foreigners as a threat to their already precarious survival. They began to build walls and barricades, sealing themselves off from the rest of the country.

Years passed, and the drought eventually came to an end. But the walls of Reldollen remained, and the once-vibrant city became a shadow of its former self. The people were now distrustful and unwelcoming to outsiders, and the city's culture and diversity began to fade away.

Still, Vedalken respected one thing: knowledge. Hence, it is to no surprise that [[Siaga]] was able to bring down the mental walls of the Reldollen. By investing in initiatives to bring foreign scholars into the city for mutual learning and tourists for the Vedalken to share their extensive history too, the Reldollen slowly opened up to visitors.

[[Leafwalker Industries]] has also made significant investments in Reldollen, particularly in the areas of sustainable agriculture and green energy. The company has worked closely with local farmers to implement innovative techniques that reduce environmental impact while boosting crop yields. This has helped to address food shortages in the region, as well as creating new opportunities for economic growth.
