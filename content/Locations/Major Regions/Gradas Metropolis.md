Gradas is a lovely mix of olden and modern Halfling culture. Aside from the architecture, this is most notable on the local cuisine. Much of the food prepared here is taken straight from the source, but the cuisine being served is a fusion of many other cultures. Halflings of Gradas say that it is the water flowing through the island that allows them to grow any plant or animal they wish for these cuisines. Obviously, some form of magic is involved. 

The city is also home to merchants selling goods that may not be that useful for adventurers. This includes small keepsakes, paintings, banners, furniture, jewelry and the like. Still, should one be looking to sell such items for a good price, there is no better place to sell them than at Gradas. Outside of that, keep a look out for the unique wines and alchemical mixes here since they are said to be unavailable elsewhere.
