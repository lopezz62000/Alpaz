As the population of [[Rojor Dunes|Rojor]] grew, the Firbolg knew that they needed to establish another city lest they risk being discovered by the giants. They came to Eldrith, the most skilled druid in all of Alpaz. As the archdruid, Eldrith had a deep connection to the natural world around him. Hearing the pleas of the Firbolg, he went out with his druid circle to find the birthing place of a new city. 

Eldrith had always dreamed of creating a city that would blend seamlessly into the landscape, a place where Firbolg and nature could coexist in harmony. He knew that such a place would require cooperation with the many spirits of the land and many more to raise the city from a desert. His druid circle searched for many years until they found a place that was the intersection of plains, deserts, rivers, and dunes.

 Eldrith began to work his magic. He called upon the spirits of the mountains and the rivers, and he began to shape the land around him. Slowly but surely, he created a fertile valley that was surrounded by towering dunes and rushing rivers. His druid circle began to cultivate the land, planting fields of wheat and barley. They built a network of irrigation canals and dams to ensure that the crops would always have enough water. 

Soon, a new city was born and the Firbolg of Rojor had a new place to live in.
