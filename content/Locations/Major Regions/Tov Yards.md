Tov is actually majestic despite it being home to the lizardfolk. The giant darkmantle which serves as the cityâ€™s Usrak is more mesmerizing than freightening. It serves as the city's main attraction even though not many would dare visit the city. The darkmantle was killed by this tribe since they have the ability to fly for short spurts of time. 

The Usrak of Tov city is that of a darkmantle.
