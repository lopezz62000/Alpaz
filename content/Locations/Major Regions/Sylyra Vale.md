In the middle of vast planes of vegetation in the country of [[Kllurian]] lies the city of Sylyra. Its year-long rainy season allows it to have abundant produce, making its farmers the most prosperous in the world. Its location — north of the Witcastle and Aerian rivers, and south of the Scratch Rock mountain range — is believed to be the cause of this weather phenomenon. During [[2. The Division|The Division]], the elves of Sylyra initially struggled to keep their plants from dying due to overwatering. They thought of ways to shield crops from the rain or redirect rainwater, but were only able to do this for a few acres. Some consulted the [[Urifir Bookbasin]] and found plants that were more resistant to overwatering. Others conducted generations of cross-pollination to produce stronger plants. The result was a city with a wide variety of plants, both old and new.

The most valuable of these is the Eten tree. Its fruit grows in pairs and never spoils as long as they stay connected. This species is believed to have originated from the country of [[Far Ran]], where extreme weather conditions prevail. However, due to cross-pollination techniques and small amounts of magic in the soil of Sylyra, the species became even more resilient. The fruit is sought after around the world — often found in the rations of adventurers.

The ever-prosperous city of Sylyra has seen little change. By [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]], the elves of Sylyra had found ways to better control the weather, enabling even more plants to prosper in the region. No longer were ugly implements needed to protect crops from overwatering. Now, the lands are filled with an abundance of plants. New pests arrived with the introduction of new plants, but have been kept away by a growing number of bees with teeth. The elves believe these pests will soon leave their crops alone, and their yield will only continue to increase.
