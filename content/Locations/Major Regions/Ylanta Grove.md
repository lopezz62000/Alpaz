Since [[1. The Creation|The Creation]], Ylanta city was not the peaceful and welcoming city that it is now. In fact, it was a city plagued by war and turmoil. The city was originally inhabited by two warring factions: the Myconids and the Yieldans. The Myconids believed in living a simple and peaceful life, while the Yieldans believed in living a life of luxury and extravagance. Both however, struggled to survive among the snow-capped mountains where only the Ylanta flower bloomed. For years, the two factions fought endlessly, each determined to survive in the harsh environment. But as the years passed, the people of Ylanta grew tired of the constant conflict and destruction.

One day, a group of dâ€™Poacery travelers from a distant land arrived in Ylanta. They were a diverse group, each bringing with them their own customs, beliefs, and traditions. The people of Ylanta welcomed them with open arms, eager to learn from their visitors.

As the travelers settled into the city, they began to share their stories and experiences with the locals. They talked of a world beyond Ylanta and beyond Gul, a world where people of different races and cultures lived together in harmony. They spoke of a place where diversity was celebrated, not feared. Slowly but surely, the people of Ylanta began to change. They started to see the value in diversity and the importance of peaceful coexistence. They began to work together, putting aside their differences and working towards a common goal.

Over time, most of the Myconids decided to move in exchange for support of the other Onodrim to wherever they would move to. Ylanta city was left to the care of the Poacery, Yeildings, and some Myconids. Today, its people continue to welcome visitors with open arms, sharing their message of peace and acceptance with the world.
