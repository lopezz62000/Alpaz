Long ago, in the time when the Vedalken had yet to perfect their emotionless nature, there was a group of Vedalken who felt the burden of their emotions more strongly than others. They found it difficult to function in society, where emotions were seen as a weakness. Together, they decided to create a new city on the banks of the [[Esrever River]], where the water flowed gently and the trees provided shade from the sun. They named it "Ultor" meaning "Liberty" in Vedalken.

As more Vedalken moved to the city, so did its reputation for beautiful artistry. Vedalken in Ultor created masterpieces of every kind, from paintings and sculptures to music and dance. People from all over the world came to see the beautiful art created in Ultor. It was during one of these visits that the famous pop star [[Allison Ingrid|Alli]] discovered Ultor. She was so impressed with the talent and creativity of the Vedalken there that she decided to establish her entertainment company, [[Alight Entertainment]], in the city.

Today, Ultor serves as a hub for discovering new musical talent and developing them into successful artists. The company has invested in state-of-the-art recording studios and performance venues, providing resources and opportunities for both local and international artists to showcase their talent.
