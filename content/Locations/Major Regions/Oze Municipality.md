Long before the city of Oze was established as the capital of [[Nhovell]], the land was inhabited by the Vedalken, who were nomadic at the time. They would move from place to place in search of knowledge, and they found themselves drawn to the area that would later become Oze. They were fascinated by the unique energy that emanated from the land and believed it held great power. They had heard tales of [[Solen Crystals]] and believed one of its sources to be within its land. Hence, a group of Vedalken known as the Masters settled here and studied the land.

Soon, the Masters became the leaders of Oze. They were responsible for making decisions that would impact the city and its inhabitants, and they were held in high regard by the Vedalken. Their word was law. Every citizen's Role was defined by the Masters.

But as time passed, the role of the Masters began to shift. The Vedalken of Oze realized that strict laws and enforcement were not the best way to pursue knowledge and growth. They began to prioritize collaboration and cooperation, and the Masters shifted from enforcers to specialists in their respective fields. They shared knowledge with those who were interested and joined the ranks of those with Roles.

Today, Oze remains the center of knowledge and innovation in [[Nhovell]]. Its hexagonal buildings and bridges connect everything in a seamless and efficient manner. The Masters continue to lead their respective fields and push the boundaries of what is possible. They have also worked with the [[Race United]] to ensure the safety and prosperity of the country and its citizens and [[Leafwalker Industries]] to development new technologies and inventions that can be commercialized. In this way, the Vedalken have no need to worry about security and economy, allowing them to focus on their research and pursuit of knowledge.
