Ghul Dal stands on the edge of [[Throldyar]]’s lush lands and [[Qroaz]]’s blighted lands. In the past, it was abandoned to the monsters that the blight nurtured. For a time, the cess pool of creatures was not claimed as a city of the dragonborn. However, with the formation of the [[Race United]], the dragonborn found a new found need and a new found strength in the form of new military trainees. 

The military leaders of the world worked together to clear the lands of Ghul Dal and established the best training facilities in all of Alpaz. With swarms of deathly creatures on the attack, it was also a great place for novice fighters to get ample experience. Sure, bad things still happen, but the doctors and generals are able to restore everything into a peaceful state.
