Once desolate, Eyildi was nothing but a brief pause between the dangers of the tundra to the north and the deserts to the west. However, after [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]] and the opening of magical channels, this area became known as a reservoir of magic. Elven high mages recognized that the blood of wild creatures in [[Far Ran]], the wild magic of [[Ajysius]], and the leaves of the [[Golden Grove]] all pour the excess of its magic into the regionâ€™s energy vacuum. As a result, the city became home to the most prestigious schools of magic and is now a beacon of knowledge and power in the [[Kllurian]]. Many scholars come here to pursue higher magical education, as well as to participate in the annual World Spelling Bee competition.

The abundance of magical energy has made Eyildi a center for the most powerful magic users in the world. Its establishments not only produce the brightest wizards but also serve as training grounds for the most outstanding bards. Furthermore, the elves have established many magical firms here, performing Rituals of Complement to create magical artifacts.

Eyildi is still filled with wonders and mysteries. [[Alight Entertainment]] scouts the lands, searching for up-and-coming stars while [[Siaga]] is on the lookout for potential artificers. On the other hand, [[Leafwalker Industries]] is banned from the area, allowing the local magic shops to prosper. The [[Race United]] is currently investigating any cases of missing individuals, though it is unclear if these organizations are involved. Despite this, there is much power to be unearthed within the city's walls.
