The city of Bretlyn looks macabre. With its rusting walls and dirty roads, Bretlyn has a dull atmosphere. The main attraction is the ancient forge, which was built 48 years ago and designed by dwarves who wanted to make a living off of modern ships
The ancient forge of Bretlyn is a marvel of engineering. It was designed by the Eujmi family of dwarves who wanted to make a living off of ships, but they could not quite figure out how to make them out of metal. For many years, the Eujmis simply focused on the ancient forge, leaving other responsibilities to the rest of the Dwarves. The Bretlyn Dwarves also expected the forge to be used for weaponry, but the Eujmis refused to use it for such. This made the city vulnerable to attacks by orcs and goblins, resulting in its current state.

This changed when the engineers of [[Boarstost City]] city in [[Eitur]] came to Bretlyn and shared their inventions during [[2. The Division|The Division]] . With the abundance of metal in the city and the large forge, it became very easy to develop new designs. Together, the humans and Eujmis created great modern ships that travelled both land and see, establishing trade routes and connecting nations. 

After that, Eujmis were able to share their fortunes with the rest of the Bretlyn Dwarves as reparation for their lack of aid during their time of need. Still, a lot of fortune remained in the hands of the Eujmis. To this day, a Eujmi stands as a Ruler of the Mountains.
