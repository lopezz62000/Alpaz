Pro: "An elven sanctuary, filled with magic from the times before The Division and not available elsewhere"
Con: "High magic is used to protect the vale, the only one publicly know is illusion that covers the entrance in mist and abjuration that prevents teleportation anywhere near The Tree"
Quirk: "Any non-elven magical item does not work in the region, including any form of modern technology"

Wrisfjel is home to the [[Golden Grove]]. Each of the trees in the grove are the manifestation of the magic bestowed upon the Elves by Corellon, many of which are not accessible to other races. This includes knowledge for creating elven artifacts, high elven rituals, and mythals. 

The largest of these trees is simply known as The Tree. It is believed that all possible forms of magic are stored within The Tree. However, such knowledge can only be obtained by consuming the Tree. It is believed that different ways of consuming the tree leads to different forms of knowledge. To this day, the clergymen of the Golden Council and the elven high priests continue to experiment on ways of consuming the tree and unlocking new forms of magic. 

The elves of Wrisfjel are very traditional and are devoted to preserving the rituals and traditions that protect the Tree. As a result, they have kept their culture unaltered by modern progress. All of the elves still reside in the gigantic trees in the region outside of the [[Golden Grove]], living in a way that has been unchanged for centuries. Their magical abilities continue to be passed down for generations.
