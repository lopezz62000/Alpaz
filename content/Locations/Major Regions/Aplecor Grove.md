In the aftermath of the war against the elementals, the Aplecor knights stationed in Barnemouth found themselves restless. Their purpose, to protect the city and its people, was no longer necessary, and they longed for a new challenge. Led by their charismatic new leader, Sir Roland, they set out to create a new city, one that would become their home and a hub for the earth elementals.

After months of searching for the perfect location, the knights came across vast cave systems just north of the [[Dinxish river]]. In these caves were refugee elementals, making a home away from persecution. With resources fit for both the Onodrim and the earth elementals, it was here that they decided to build their new city, which they named Aplecor. The knights worked tirelessly to create a city with their bare hands. Slowly but surely, the earth elementals began to take notice, and they started to make Aplecor their new home.

The city of Aplecor grew rapidly, and soon it became a bustling hub of activity. The Aplecor knights took on new responsibilities as protectors of the earth elementals, and they formed a strong bond with their new neighbors. As word of the city's unique population spread, adventurers and curious travelers from all over Alpaz began to flock to Aplecor, eager to witness the earth elementals firsthand.

Despite the city's growing popularity, it remained a place for the brave. Visitors had to be cautious and respectful of the earth elementals, who could be unpredictable and dangerous if provoked. But those who were willing to take the risk were rewarded with a glimpse into a world that few had ever seen before.
