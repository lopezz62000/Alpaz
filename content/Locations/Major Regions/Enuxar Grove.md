Enuxar City was once a swampland. However, to fulfill the Enuxarâ€™s final wishes, the people of Barnemouth worked to create a city that would welcome if not celebrate all cultures in Alpaz. Under the leadership of [[Sarkiar d'Poacery|Sarkiar]], a good friend of the late grand wizard, the Onodrim were determined to bring life to this land and honor Enuxar.

For years, the Onodrim worked tirelessly, using their diminishing powers to cultivate the land and bring forth lush plant life. Each plant was grown with proper reason, creating buildings and facilities that served the needs and preferences of the races of Alpaz. Over time, the city began to take shape. Plants grew tall and strong, forming the framework for the buildings and other structures that would come to define Enuxar city.

As the city grew, word spread throughout [[Dreamsprout]] of this dream for a city that all could enjoy. Onodrim from all over the country flocked to Enuxar, eager to see the wonders of this new city for themselves. Many even decided to help out and make this dream a reality. In the end, the Onodrim were able to create a place that is not only beautiful, but functional and welcoming to all.
