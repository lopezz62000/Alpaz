The Elves of Virris City have long been admired for their beauty, their hospitality, and their love for their deities. The landscape of Virris City is breathtaking, with its red-leaved trees, luscious hills, and calm lakes. It is also home to the largest temples in the world, with a variety of deities being represented. 

The people of Virris City are also known for their creativity and their love of the arts. They are a vibrant and active community, and they are constantly finding new ways to express themselves through their art. They are also passionate about music, and love to gather together to listen to their favorite songs and to create new ones. Many of the Virrisian elves believe that their artistic expression also serves as a form of worship to their deities.

For these reasons and more, many people come to visit the city of Virris. The elves of Virris are polite and welcoming to those who come from outside their borders, believing that foreigners could bring greater prosperity and worship for their deities. Still, the Virrisian elves are concerned that the amount of benefits their deities receive from such tourism may be more trouble than its worth.
