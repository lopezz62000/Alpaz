During [[1. The Creation|The Creation]], [[Dreamsprout]] was barren and lifeless, with only a few scattered trees and bushes. However, a divine spark brought to life the first Onodrim: the d'Poaceries. The d'Poacery were a rare and magical race of vine-made creatures. They were blessed by Psilofyr, the deity of the Onodrim, with the ability to bring life to any land they touched.

With their powers, the d'Poacery began to cultivate the land, planting beautiful and colorful flowers that bloomed with radiant colors. The Pacery soon realized that their vines could grow upwards and create towering structures that provided shelter and security for their community. Thus, Drusea was born, a vibrant city bursting with life and color.

As the d'Poacery flourished and the city grew, they discovered that their vines could also provide nourishment. They began to create an abundance of fruits, vegetables, and other edible plants that sustained their growing population. As they continued to bring life into the land, the Poacery brought sentience to other creatures that grew from the ground. From their powers, the Myconid and Yeildans came into being. Unbeknownst to them, this resulted in the weakening of their power to cultivate the land with magic, as it drained Psilofyr.

Still, the d'Poacery adapted. Without much magic to fill the land with, they learned how to maximize their divine energy and cultivate the land through other means. Over time, the d'Poacery began to build structures that extended up into the trees, creating a vertical city that was a wonder to behold. Visitors marveled at the d'Poacery's ingenuity and their ability to live in harmony with the land.

Today, Drusea remains a vibrant and colorful city, a testament to the Poacery's ingenuity. The vines that created the city have grown to become the backbone of its infrastructure, providing support and nourishment to the Poacery and the visitors who come to marvel at their way of life.
