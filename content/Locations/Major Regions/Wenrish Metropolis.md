Wenrishâ€™s landscape is enjoyable; imposing fjords, refreshing lakes and gorgeous farmlands are just a sliver of the spectacles Wenrish has to offer. On top of that, many tradesmen providing services reside and set up shop on the island. The unpaved streets of Wenrish are a stark contrast to the elaborately designed homes that they lead to, each one displaying the type and quality of services its resident provides. From carpentry, designing, and transportation to enchantment, healing, and teleportation, there is no service that the Halflings of Wenrish cannot provide.

There was a time when entertainers also resided on the island. However, with the establishment of [[Alight Entertainment]] disappeared. This occured for multiple reasons. Many saw that entertainment services were no longer viable and changed their businesses. Others moved to [[Nhovell]] to stay in touch with the industry. Some were recruited while some are said to have been kidnapped. Still, there are some entertainers on the island, but they are few and far between.
