The Trulnyl Dwarves had been a proud and prosperous people since [[2. The Division|The Division]] but had been dealt a heavy blow in the wake of [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]]. Being masters of dwarven blacksmithing and defensive architecture, they grew rich during the time of fighting by selling their weaponry to neighboring cities in [[Ilor]] and other countries. They were also very confident in their defenses, fearing no siege from any enemies. 

However, when the wars ended, their production slowed and their defenses degraded. What they did not know is that the orcs and goblins were working together to prepare an attack. On the fateful night, the Siege of Trulnyl began. The Trulnyl Dwarves reached out for help to the neighboring cities of [[Ilor]], but the Ruler of the Mountains in Trulnyl was unwilling to give up any gold in exchange for their aid. As a result, the people of Trulnyl threw their Ruler off [[Mount Grouleac]] into the front lines where they died. Very quickly, the Dwarves offered all of the riches of the deceased ruler in exchange for help. Aid soon came, but not without half of the population dying to the seige. 

The Trulnyl Dwarves had learned a valuable lesson from their experience and became determined to never let themselves become so vulnerable again. To this day, they remain a proud and prosperous people, and their city is renowned for its new strong defenses.
