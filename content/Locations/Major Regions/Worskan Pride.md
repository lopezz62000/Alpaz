Pro: "Magical items for sale everywhere at proper prices and no scams"
Con: "The market bleeds erroneous items that are sold for cheap outside of Worskan jurisdiction and they tend to have terrible effects on the city’s poor"
Quirk: "It is said that merchants here can smell if you have any money — and will ignore you if you don’t"

Worskan City has been a place of power and industry for as long as anyone can remember. It was once a bustling metropolis filled with factories, churning out weapons of war, but now it has been transformed. The factories have been repurposed to create magical devices and tools that benefit all peoples of the world.

The Worskan Dragonborn are a proud and noble race, revered for their strong connection to the arcane and their mastery of the magical arts. They rule the city with an iron fist, making sure that all its citizens obey their laws and regulations. Although their reign is strict, it is also fair and just; the Dragonborn do not show favoritism and seek to provide for the best interests of all.

The city itself is a sight to behold. Gleaming towers reach to the sky, and the streets are lined with shops, restaurants, and other establishments. There is a great market, where one can find almost anything they need, from magical trinkets to the finest fabrics. The city is a vibrant, thriving place, and the Dragonborn have done their best to maintain the beauty and grandeur of the past.

The citizens of the city are a diverse mix of races and cultures, all living in harmony. The Dragonborn rule with a firm but fair hand, and the people of the city have come to trust and respect them. They are a loyal people, and they are willing to fight to defend their city and its people.

The city is also a safe haven for those who seek refuge from the troubles of the world. The Dragonborn provide ample protection and security, and those who seek solace in their walls are not disappointed. They are a hospitable people, and they welcome all who come in peace.
