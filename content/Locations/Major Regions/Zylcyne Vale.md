Zylcyne is the capital of [[Kllurian]] and the home of the majestic [[amethyst castle]] of the high elves. During [[2. The Division|The Division]], the city served as the main military base for elves, training and planning most of their maneuvers within it. All intel also funneled through the walls of the walls of the [[amethyst castle]] and accordingly addressed by the Golden Council. 

Today, after [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]] and the founding of the [[Race United]], much of the elven military force has been moved to protect the [[Golden Grove]] or [[Fallion Pride]]. Zyclyne has been turned into the primary outpost for the [[Race United]] forces in the continent of Nol. Additionally, all the functions of the [[Race United]] are split between its headquarters and the [[amethyst castle]] as a failsafe from large scale attacks. 

Unlike [[Fallion Pride]] however, the vale has must less diversity, being mostly occupied by elves. This is not because of any discrimination, but because elves are most at ease when close to the [[Golden Grove]]. Hence, though many elves do with to work with the [[Race United]], they would rather stay in [[Kllurian]] than in foreign lands. Hence, they take up most of the space in Zyclyne. As a result of this, less people are able to come to this secondary [[Race United]] headquarters for help with any sort of conflict. Instead, the Zyclyne elves offer rare forms of healing, addressing curses and reviving those that they can.
