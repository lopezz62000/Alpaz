In the early days of [[Zerathin]], Vel Grea was nothing more than a small village, a pit stop for weary travelers looking for shelter and rest. But as the country grew, so did the importance of Vel Grea. It became a key location for trade and commerce, as it was situated at the base of [[Kilrakir peaks]], a treacherous and inhospitable region that people had to pass in order to get to and from Throldyar in the fastest time possible.

As trade flourished, the village grew into a bustling city, attracting people from all over [[Zerathin]] and beyond. But with growth came challenges. The Skyrider Clan, a notorious group of bandits and raiders, began to see Vel Grea as a prime target for their raids. The city's defenses were weak, and it was only a matter of time before disaster struck.

One fateful night, the Skyrider descended upon Vel Grea, catching the city off guard. Chaos and destruction followed, as the raiders pillaged and burned everything in their path. The city was left in ruin, but the people of Vel Grea were not defeated. They banded together and swore to rebuild their city, stronger and more resilient than ever before. They fortified their defenses, trained their militias, and established a network of allies and informants to keep an eye on the Skyrider Clan.

Since then, it has had the Pale Lighthouse to serve as a guard tower. Although it was mainly used to watch against the Skyriders, it has also been used to keep an eye out for dragonborn travelling from [[Zofrika Pride|Zofrika]] to [[Yorayi Fort|Yorayi]].

Over time, Vel Grea regained its strength and reputation as a key location for trade and commerce. But the memory of that fateful night still lingered, a reminder of the fragility of life in the [[Kilrakir peaks]]. The people of Vel Grea continued to be vigilant, never forgetting the lessons of their past.
