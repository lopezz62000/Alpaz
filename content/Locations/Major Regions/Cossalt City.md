Cossalt City in the country of [[Eitur]] was a shunned destination among foreigners. Its landscape was sinister, with concealed hill views, gloomy forests, and destructive waterfalls. The people of Cossalt did not know the exact reasons for their predicament, but they found ways to survive in their secluded city. 

However, everything changed when the Shunned Destinations Inc. found the city. What was considered terrible living conditions was seen as prime real estate for adventuring companies looking for quests closer to home that werenâ€™t too challenging. Soon, the city became known as the proving grounds for any would-be adventurers. 

Today, the city is still not the best place to live. However, its citizens have flourished under the new businesses centered on supporting adventurers. What was once a quiet and desolate city has not become a city of chaos in which some people truly thrive.
