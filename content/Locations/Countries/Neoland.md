Country: "[[Neoland]]"
---
Neoland is the newest country in Alpaz. Its inhabitants are mostly halflings. 

The land was discovered by [[The Explorer]] on their journey to map out the world of Alpaz. Upon its discovery, the cartographer was surprised to see the land inhabited by halflings. Although halflings were already present in the main two continents, they never had a true home country until that day. 

It is unknown on what side of the barrier Neoland was in during [[2. The Division|The Division]]. However, it’s people were quick to make social connections with the world. Hence, whatever technological and magical progress it had missed during that age was quickly regained. 

To capitalize on all this was Fastrada Leafwalker who united the businesses of Alpaz to form [[Leafwalker Industries]]. Having grown up in a country which had none of the resources of either Gul and Nol, Fastrada ensured that basic and adventuring commodities were available in all countries. Of course, in the process, she made herself and many business owners very rich. 

 Leafwalker, unfortunately, died in the year 151 UY. The circumstances of her death are still unknown. 

Neoland has great standings with [[Siaga]], sponsoring many new inventors and helping them create the next big business. The country actually has negative relations with [[Alight Entertainment]], seeing them as a competitor. After all, people only had so much money to go around. The country has slightly positive relations with [[Race United]] and [[Urifir Bookbasin]], both good business partners and sources of information for the next big thing. 

### Governmental Structure

The people of Neoland live under a corporatocracy where the tradesmen’s guild and government are one and the same. All national decisions are voted on by the Board, of which any business owner is allowed to be a part of. The Board is headed by the Corporate Future Oracle or CFO who cannot be part of any business.

During Board meetings, a Zone of Truth spell is cast on the CFO as they put on a Crystal Visor. The Crystal Visor allows the CFO to answer any question with a “yes”, “no”, or “unclear” with increasing inaccuracy as more questions are asked in a day. Any member of the Board is then allowed to make a petition. For every petition, the question “will this benefit the citizens of Neoland 10 years from now?” must be asked. Petitions are then voted on and meetings adjourned through movements made by board members. 

### Geographical Information

The country of Neoland is made up of four major islands, each one with a city named after the island. There are no other cities, although towns and settlements do exist. The cities are as follows: Wenrish city to the north, Faycub city to the west, Gradas city to the south, and Jilfica city to the southeast.
