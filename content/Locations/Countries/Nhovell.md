Country: "[[Nhovell]]"
---
Vedalken have always been after perfection and knowledge. How then, you ask, is Nhovell the world’s capital for entertainment? There are multiple reasons, but the most important one is the three forms of knowledge the Vedalken care about.

For technological knowledge, Vedalken have simply migrated to the countries of the Nologite continent which have had millennia to develop their technology due to [[2. The Division|The Division]]. For magical knowledge, Vedalken have taken to the skies, studying the magic of the air elementals who visit from the portals to the plane of air hovering above Nhovell. This leaves social knowledge. Vedalken could have simply migrated to other locations to learn of the world's cultures. However, by the end of [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]], Nhovell itself was already attracting many tourists. This was thanks to the newly built resorts on Nhovell (White Witch’s Way by Glenda the Lawmaster and Saffron Bluff) and the presence of SheeLDs (recreational(?) drugs that were brought by [[Meili Hue|Meili]] the Businesswoman). Hence, the Vedalken who remained on Nhovell were those who loved to learn about people and creatures. 

To further attract more of their research subjects, Vedalken have created new entertainment industries. This includes theater, music, paintings, dance, movies, illusory realities, weavenet, elementism, and so much more. In addition, they established a new form of knowledge to perfect: arts knowledge. 

Nhovell serves as the headquarters of [[Alight Entertainment]] and hosts the location for its annual art exhibition, the Universal Gala. The country holds strong relations with [[Urifir Bookbasin]], providing the organization with latest information for long-term storage. Although the government has no official business with [[Siaga]], its people continue to be fond of the organization’s technological advancements and supports them when possible. As for the [[Race United]], the country is indifferent, seeing them as a necessity to survival only in a war-filled world. Finally, the country has negative relations with [[Leafwalker Industries]], seeing as people would have to choose between doing something for fun or buying something for themselves.

Overall, it seems that Nhovell is a diverse country with a mix of cultures and technologies. However, there are also hints of dark undertones, such as the United Council's involvement with the Masters and their concern about the Alcazar, as well as the underground drug market in Liplazosh.

### Governmental Structure

Nhovell has a technocratic government. The group of technical experts that serve as their governing body are known as the Masters of Oze. Each of the three Masters have their own field of expertise, covering the three forms of knowledge the Vedalken hold dear. These Masters are encouraged to have their own group of scholars known as Students who serve as both apprentices and advisors. 

A week before a Master passes away, they are notified by one of the land’s diviners. During this time, they must choose a successor, preferably from their Students. Should no successor be chosen, the Students must decide amongst themselves who the successor should be. It is currently unknown what would happen should the Master have no Students during their passing and they have not named a successor.
