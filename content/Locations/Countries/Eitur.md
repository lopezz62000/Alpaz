Country: "[[Eitur]]"
---
Eitur, the land of progress. Originally tasked with guarding the portal during [[2. The Division|The Division]], they immediately went to work to make the tools needed to succeed in their jobs. Although the humans who primarily inhabited the country were not necessarily the brightest in the land, they did know how to work together. Furthermore, they were the bravest, daring to travel the world of Nol to recruit individuals who could help them in their task. 

The best of these recruits was [[Tranquil Snow]], a Tabaxi who had discovered many things including the powers of Solen crystals. The nation of Eitur made quick progress, developing weapons and technologies faster than any nation. Soon enough, the portal was secured with a lock that immediately disintegrated anything that came near it. In addition to this, [[Tranquil Snow]] created the Tinker Boxes, items that created magic-like effects in a world without any magic. Soon after these achievements, however, [[Tranquil Snow]] was assassinated by drow. The original Tinker Boxes were stolen and any information on the portal locks was lost. 

During [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]], the people of Eitur took it upon themselves to honor the fallen inventor. Thus, [[Siaga]] was born. Much like the beginnings of the nation, the organization seeks the brightest minds and gives them the resources to create what they could imagine. With so much inventions born from it, Eitur quickly became the center of technology in Alpaz. 

Eitur has positive relations with the other four multinational organizations, prioritizing collaboration in order to continue their technological advancement. However, they have branched out, developing non-military based technologies to support other countries.

### Governmental Structure

Eitur is ruled by a democratic government although it is quite new. Up until just before [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]], Eitur has a monarchy. However, the royal family was murdered and the only known survivor, the princess, went missing. Hence, the monarchy crumbled and the people cried for a new ruling body. It was then that the leader of the military recognized the importance of collaboration in human society and established a new government in democratic structure. 

Interestingly, for national elections, citizens of other nations are can be chosen to vote for the next leaders of Eitur. How this works is that a ballot tablet is sent randomly to a set number of people internationally, split evenly among the other nations. The total number of of such ballots is at most equal to the population of Eitur.

### Geographical Structure
