![[Throldyar Logo.png|200]]

The home of the Dragonborn is Throldyar. It has the smallest area among the countries of the Gulian continent. Its land used to be protected by the dragons who would very often perch atop the tall buildings of the Dragonborn. 

During [[2. The Division|The Division]], Throldyar went into a rough patch. With the invisible barrier's appearance and the [[Draconic Exodus]], their king falling ill, the dragonborn were uneasy. When the fiends began spreading from open portals to Avernus and the [[Blood War]], the dragonborn thought the worse. However, Lumiseth, their king, awoke and fought back against the fiends. When the battle was over, he promised the Dragonborn power to fight for themselves, a power which he convinced them to use against the rest of the world. Hence, began [[Lumiseth’s Campaign]]. To this day, the marks of its wars can still be seen in the dilapidated outer cities. 

However, Throldyar is a symbol of hope. It is the site where [[The Agents of Chaos]] were formed and took down King Lumiseth during [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]]. It is the site where the world began to change. The people of Throldyar want to keep being that source of hope.

This is why the [[Race United]] was formed – to be a light in the darkest of times and a measure to prevent those dark times from happening. The country now serves as a melting pot of cultures, playing host to many small organizations and businesses started by people from all over the world. 

The country has greatly positive relations with all multinational organizations, trading protection for resources needed to continue the gradual rebuilding of its nation.

### Governmental Structure

Throldyar is a meritocracy, led by a council of Dragonborn called The Flight of Flames or the Flight. Together, they are deemed to be the best group of Dragonborn to help the country flourish. By who is it decided? It is unknown. All the Dragonborn know is that a day before the Flight changes, fire in the shape of wings appears in the sky above mount [[Mount Kikijith]]. Exactly 24 hours thereafter, the new Flight members are teleported to the Cliff Hall, located at the top of the mountain. 

The members of The Flight of Flames have always been at least two. They are each allowed a day to gather their own advisers before assuming duty as the new Flight of Flames. This also gives the previous Flight a time to consolidate their plans should they no longer be part of the new Flight. 

### Geographical Information

Throldyar has 6 major cities and isn’t really split into regions. At the country’s center is Fallion which serves as the country’s capital and the headquarters of the [[Race United]]. To its west, at the coast, is Caeqrin and to its east is Worskan — it’s two most prosperous cities. To Fallion’s south is Ghul Dal, to the southeast is Nyssira, and to the southwest is Zofrika, cities left to the decay of war that have only recently been restored.
