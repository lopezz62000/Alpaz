Country: "[[Dreamsprout]]"
---
Dreamsprout is home to the Onodrim, a plant-based population. There are three types of Onodrim: myconid from mushrooms, poacery from grass and vines, and yeildans from trees and fruits.

After [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]], the country has also served as a home away from home for all elementals. Since [[2. The Division|The Division]], the Onodrim have dealt no damage to the resources of their land and have, in fact, nourished it. As a result, elementals grew fond of the land.

Dreamsprout’s previous monarch, [[Sarkiar d'Poacery|Sarkiar]] d’Poacery, went to law school in [[Eitur]]. She was a great help in the unification of the two worlds and is a co-founder of the [[Race United]]. She worked with many elementals to make Dreamsprout the home it is today. [[Sarkiar d'Poacery|Sarkiar]] is the only ruler to have remained in power since the beginning of [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]].

The country has deep relations with [[Race United]], serving as training grounds for its soldiers. It has sour relations with [[Alight Entertainment]] who wishes to capitalize on the attraction elementals have to the country. The kingdom’s council believes that allowing the businesses of [[Alight Entertainment]] into the country will only damage its land and its resources. Surprisingly, the country has a great partnership with [[Leafwalker Industries]] which provides it with all the many products needed for the comfort of both the Onodrim and the elementals (for a price of course). The country is indifferent to both [[Urifir Bookbasin]] and [[Siaga]] although they have asked for help from both organizations when needed. Specifically, it has looked into artifact making and what it can tell about the country’s history. 

### Governmental Structure

A loose monarchy rules the many groves of Dreamsprout. The king or queen is accompanied by two advisers, each one representing one of the other two subraces of the Onodrim. These advisers also serve as primary teachers of the next generation of monarchs. In fact, should the two advisers agree, they are allowed to remove any candidate from consideration as the next monarch. Similarly, the two advisers are also able to add candidates should they both agree. Finally, should the next generation of candidates be too young during the monarch’s passing, one of the advisers rises as a temporary monarch and a new temporary adviser of the previous monarch’s subrace is appointed. At this point, the temporary adviser loses control over the possible candidates. 

Given that Onodrim can live very long lives, it can take a while before a new monarch is appointed. For this reason, a monarch can also step down from their throne to make way for a new monarch. Upon death, all monarchs are buried under [[the Black Oak]] to giver nourishment to a new Spiritual Branch through which they can provide continued guidance to future generations.

### Geographical Information

Dreamsprout is located around the equator of Alpaz in the continent of Gul, above the country of [[Throldyar]] and below [[Nhovell]]. The country is split into a northern and southern region by the [[Roolber hills]] situated right at the equator. There are nine major cities in Dreamsprout.

The northern region has three major cities: Ylanta, Ingby, and Drusea. Ylanta city is sandwiched north of [[Mount Nylbid]] and south of [[Athvell Peaks]]. A little south of [[Mount Nylbid]] is Ingby city. Finally, just north of [[Roolber hills]] and south of Ingby is Drusea city. 

The southern region is split into two parts: the irrigated region and the rain region. The irrigated region is irrigated by the [[Dinxish river]]. On the western coast is Ryliedo city.  To Ryliedo’s northeast is Barnemouth city. Finally, at the valley south east of both cities is Aplecor city. In the rain region, there is Waterspout city at the tip of [[Dinxish river]], Enuxar city at the northeastern valley, and Ydmry city at the eastern coast.
