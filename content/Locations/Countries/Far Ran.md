Country: "[[Far Ran]]"
---
Far Ran is the only country in Alpaz with no form of government. It is mainly inhabited by Tabaxi clans, although it is also home to Giants, some types Elementals, and many dangerous creatures. In addition, it is said that Dragons once made their homes within the mountains of Far Ran before they disappeared. 

Far Ran is famous for its many adventure locations, all of which the Tabaxi are fond of. From mountain-sized monsters to mimic infested dungeons, there is no trip here that cannot be turned into a story (both good and bad). Hence, even though it is not the most habitable of places, the Tabaxi are here to stay. 

Since [[1. The Creation|The Creation]], Tabaxi have been known to store all sorts of notes on their adventures. As time passed, these stories, pictures, and artifacts were stored in the [[Great Library of the North]], open for any traveler to read. It is said that the first recorded discovery of [[Solen crystals]] is actually within these archives.

Naturally, [[Alight Entertainment]] has capitalized on the country. The lands of Far Ran are the best elementism destination in all of Alpaz, with adventuring trails of all levels of difficulty. Are the Tabaxi concerned? Absolutely not. This just means more people to go on adventures with and more people to save from danger and more people to hear their stories. In addition, [[Leafwalker Industries]] is here to provide all adventurers, new and old, with exactly what they need to survive the day. 

The Tabaxi also have quite positive relations with [[Siaga]], offering to be part of any tests they could think of. They are, however, indifferent to [[Urifir Bookbasin]] since they don’t really need any sort of knowledge on their everyday adventures and they don’t accept stories. Finally, they absolutely abhor [[Race United]] for trying to make the country a “safer” place for everybody.

### Governmental Structure

The Tabaxi live in clans, each of which is led by the clan elders called Claws. Each clan also had several patrol groups known as Hunts. Clans do not engage in any way with other clans, not even for trade or national concerns.  Hence, there is not government to speak of.

The clans live in secret. They are not nomadic, but they move whenever they are discovered. 

### Geographic Information

There are no cities to note of. However, [[Race United]] has set up several outposts throughout the country. 

The [[Austere Beast Pass]] has the southernmost outpost which all people will pass by lest they go through [[Scratch Rock Range]]. To its northwest is the outpost at the center of [[Bite Mark Coppice]] while to its north is the Frozen Wave Outpost along the northern coast. 

At the tallest point of the mountain range to the east of Far Ran is Scratch Rock Outpost. To its northwest is [[Silent Riddle plains]] and to its southwest [[Fluffy Smoke forest]], each with their own outpost. 

### Multinational Organizations and Involvement

1. [[Alight Entertainment]]: AE has set up daily trips to each of the outposts which people can go to for a small price. On each trip, they are accompanied by an entertainment adventurer who takes them through quests, serving as somewhat of a tour guide.
2. [[Siaga]]: [[Siaga]] researchers often visit outposts in search of Tabaxi and adventurers willing to use their experimental inventions on their quests. 
3. [[Race United]]: The organization is responsible for setting up all the outposts for travellers. They are trying to set up larger military outposts, but any efforts in doing so have been thwarted by nearby Tabaxi clans. 
4. [[Void Space Legion]]: [[Void Space Legion|VSL]] has been spotted in the lands for unknown reasons. It is said that they stop certain events undercover, but some people believe they are looking for the [[Great Library of the North]]. 
5. [[Urifir Bookbasin]]: No involvement in the country.
6. [[Leafwalker Industries]]: The group of companies have set up stalls at each outpost, providing every adventurer need imaginable.
