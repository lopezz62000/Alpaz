Country: "[[Ajysius]]"
---
Ajysius is a country of deserts and wild magic. It serves as the home of the Firbolg. Firbolg descended from giants who once roamed the lands of Ajysius. More giants, however, were destructive beings, unable to take care of lands in a way that sustained the whole race. They much preferred pillaging and looting instead of settling down into cities. The exception to this is the Firbolg who made beautiful cities in what was becoming a country of deserts. 

It is believed that the Firbolg use powerful magic borrowed from the feywild to cover all locations of their clan grounds. In this way, they were able to protect themselves from the giants. It is unknown how the Firbolg got access to this magic during [[2. The Division|The Division]], but it is believed that they found ways to harness the powers of the wild magic zones in the region.

To this day, the Firbolg live in seclusion in Ajysius. Many have said that within many pockets of the desert lie lush forest that are home to Firbolg and other fey-kind. The giant-descended population are the kindest in the world and make all decisions for the best of their communities. 

Being the only country with access to magic in Nol during [[2. The Division|The Division]], Firbolg took it upon themselves to become historians, keepers of information both new and old. Although knowledge was plenty, the Firbolg only ever used it to be of help to other nations and only if they were never repaid. During [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]], the Firbolg opened up Urifir Bookbasin, the largest library and magical database in all of Alpaz. 

The country have stellar relations with the [[Race United]], trading the protection of its people for knowledge and wisdom of the Firbolg. The nation absolutely abhors [[Leafwalker Industries]] and [[Alight Entertainment]] since the two organizations tend to make decisions in order to benefit from other people – a moral that goes against the Firbolg code. Finally, Ajysius is indifferent to [[Siaga]] as it has kind people and destructive people within the organization.

### Governmental Structure

The Firbolg are led under a parliamentary system. The individuals who make up the parliament are known as the Holders of Harmony. Each of the major cities are represented by one individual in the parliament. In addition, they are allowed to petition for the inclusion of another individual in the parliament which can represent any city, major or minor. These are known as Primary and Secondary Holder respectively.

The manner in which these individuals are chosen are up to the cities themselves itself. Most cities have decided to decide by vote, although there are still major cities that use other methods. For example, Elecan city chooses the eldest and closest living relative of Eldrith, their forefather, to be part of the parliament as their Primary Holder.  Xaelyth, on the other hand, selects their most successful merchant to be their Secondary Holder. Finally, it is of important to note that Rojor refuses to select a Secondary Holder to as to minimize the city’s power in the parliament given that it is already the capital.

### Geographic Information

Ajysius is located on the western coast of Nol, jutting out as a peninsula. It is separated into two deserts by the [[Rainpath River]]: the [[Dewsong Desert]] to the west and the [[Thiashen Desert]] to the east. 

The [[Dewsong Desert]] spans the north and western border of Ajysius, covering its only land border to [[Kllurian]]. It is manageable to travel here, but the sand storms pick up as one gets closer to Xaelyth City, the only major city in the [[Dewsong Desert]].

The [[Thiashen Desert]], on the other hand, is excruciatingly hot. Traveling here without magic is suicide. One can travel the banks of the [[Rainpath River]], but they are infested with monsters and malicious tribes. If lucky, one might stumble upon the three major cities in the region. North of the desert is Elecan City. In the middle is Rojor City. Finally, just north of the equator and at the southernmost region of the country is Chezana City.
