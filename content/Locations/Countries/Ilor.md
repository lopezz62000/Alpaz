Country: "[[Ilor]]"
---
Ilor, the mining archipelago country, is ruled by dwarves. However, there are actually more kobolds and gnomes living here than dwarves. 

Dwarves loved gold as it created the most beautiful metallurgic crafts which they gave as offerings to Moradin, the Dwarffather. During [[2. The Division|The Division]], the dwarves only mined for gold and iron, the latter of which was only valuable since it helped them mine more gold. As they continued to mine, they discovered the kobolds and gnomes which seemed to spawn out of nowhere. However, they were not much of a bother in their business of gaining more gold. 

Soon, however, there was no more gold to gather and infighting began. Iron and mithril were taken from the mines, not to find more gold but to shed blood. In no time, the number of dwarves dwindled and the kobolds and gnomes ran all over. During this time, the land of Ilor became attractive to goblins and orcs who thought they could replace the primary inhabitants of the land. During this time, the Dwarves reunited to fight against a common enemy and was blessed by Moradin with new mountains filled with iron and mithril, but there was no new gold to be found. In remembrance of this, the Dwarves, to this day, carve memorials in deep caverns to their Dwarffather.

There were, however, a group of dwarves who got greedy and defected from the war against the goblins and orcs to dig deeper in old mines. Instead of finding the gold they were hoping for, they only found captivity among mind flayers who turned them into Deurgar. 

By the time of [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]], many more types of ore became valuable to the world. Hence, they revisited all their mines to get more ore for the whole world. Today, Ilor remains the richest country in the world. In the end, the Dwarves still ended up with more gold than they dreamed of. 

The Dwarves are big supporters of [[Siaga]] and the [[Race United]] who serve as their biggest customers and sources of gold. They have positive relations with [[Leafwalker Industries]] who provide a never-ending supply of good ale for cheap. They do, however, have a slight distaste for [[Alight Entertainment]] since they don't really provide the kind of entertainment the Dwarves like. Finally, they are indifferent to [[Urifir Bookbasin]], simply because there wasnâ€™t much information about the Dwarves to begin with but they do have some insights into rocks, metals, and jewels.

### Governmental Structure

The Dwarves are rules by an aristocratic class. This class is made up of the richest Dwarf from the three major cities. These three Dwarves are called the Rulers of the Mountains. Being the only person that is part of the aristocratic class in each city is quite a precarious position. Hence, the Rulers of the Mountains are also known for being strong combatants and/or benevolent rulers. 

It used to be very difficult to know who the richest Dwarf was in a city. Many of the times, it went down eyeballing. However, to prevent any unfair counts, rare Dwarven magic was developed. It is unknown what other applications this magic has (or if its accurate), but Dwarves trust it more than banks to this day.  

### Geographic Information

Ilor is composed of three main islands. In order of decreasing size, these islands are Yamrean Island to the southwest, Grouleac Island to the north, and Numrar Island to the east. Each of these islands are home to a city. Yamrean Island is home to Gernrom city. Grouleac is home to Trulnyl city. Finally, Numrar Island is home to Bretlyn city. Other cities exist, although most of them are in mountains or underground.

### Multinational Organizations and Involvement

1. [[Alight Entertainment]]: The entertainment industry has not been able to establish any relations with the country, although they have hired a few Dwarves for their circus.
2. [[Siaga]]: [[Siaga]] has made a contract with all of the major cities to provide them with a constant source of precious metals. 
3. [[Race United]]: The [[Race United|RU]] has set up a military outpost on Grouleac Island. This is to protect Trulnyl city, but it is also to have direct access to the best blacksmiths on the planet. 
4. [[Void Space Legion]]: The [[Void Space Legion|VSL]] has been spotted talking with the Eujmis in hopes of learning more about the ancient forge. However, the reasons for which are unknown.
5. [[Urifir Bookbasin]]: The researchers of the Bookbasin have paid high prices to enter the mines of Gernrom city and study their precious gems. However, it is said that they are given a discount since they are sharing information that is simply increasing the Dwarven fame.
6. [[Leafwalker Industries]]: Every day, large amounts of ale are delivered to each of the cities of the country. They probably receive more than just gold from the Dwarves.
