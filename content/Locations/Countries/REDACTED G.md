> Gibolath, home of the Triton many leagues under the sea. Few know of the existence of this country. 
> 
> During [[2. The Division|The Division]], the country of Gibolath resided within one giant hole of the barrier although it was not known to the Triton at that time. When the barrier formed, a portal to the far realms was revealed. Its residents believe that the powers of the far realm were actually the ones responsible for the inability of the barrier to split the country in half. During this age, both [[Eitur]] and [[Zerathin]] kingdoms knew of the country's existence. In fact, their belief that the world beyond the barrier was dangerous was due to the unstable creatures that would cross the portal to the far realm. Both countries entrusted the protection of the portal to the other world, providing them with technological and magical support. 
> 
> When the barrier fell during [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]], only then did they realize what the portal actually was. Upon the formation of the [[Race United]], the governments of the world agreed to keep Gibolath and the portal under wraps. They assembled a group of individuals called [[REDACTED B]] to keep an eye out for the far realm and any impacts it may have on the world.
>  
> As [[4. The Calm|The Calm]] occurred, activity around the portal seems to have grown stronger. 
> 
> Gibolath only has relations with the [[Race United]]. All forms of technology, information, and entertainment are given to the country through the RU.
