Country: "[[Qroaz]]"
---
No country stinks more than Qroaz. This is simply because the Lizardfolk live in homes made of gigantified carcasses of creatures. Little is known about the history of Qroaz and its cities since there is little written record of them.

Lizardfolk were the only species in Gul that had little to no knowledge of magic during [[2. The Division|The Division]]. As a result, the most dangerous of creatures in Gul migrated to the land of Qroaz. Not being able to cross to other lands due to the warmongering Dragonborn, Lizardfolk had to live among these creatures. To ensure the safety of every tribe, Lizardfolk had to mark their territory. Their elders figured that, if they were able to slay some of the less dangerous monsters and keep them as a sign of the danger Lizardfolk pose, these monsters would stay at bay. The plan worked, but only against creatures who were smaller than those killed. When the Lizardfolk could no longer kill any larger creature, the few people who could use magic worked together to enlarge the carcasses of those creatures they had already slain. The Lizardfolk were safe and even the Dragonborn were kept at bay. Soon, these dead creatures simply became the home of the Lizardfolk. 

After [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]], most Lizardfolk actually remained in their lands believing it is the best place for survival. This is because they don’t quite understand how other people work, caring about things beyond just survival. Regardless, they now have somewhat positive relations with [[Throldyar]] believing that, as descendants of the dragons, they also hold formidable power.

During [[4. The Calm|The Calm]], they did lose their most prominent building, the carcass of a giant ancient black dragon. They are now in search for the necromancer who brought it back to life, but they are also in search for the dragon itself, hoping to be allies to the most powerful creature they know.

### Governmental Structure

The Lizardfolk of Qroaz still live in tribes. Their chief is the strongest member of the tribe and is commonly accompanied by two lieutenants and a shaman. Anyone in these positions can be challenged, although these rarely happen. However, should a challenger succeed in killing a  leader, they are reserved the right to consume the corpse. This is divergent from the usual practice in which a deceased member of the tribe is ceremonially consumed by the rest of the tribe, making them a part of tribe even in death. In the case of a successful challenge, it is believed that the previous leader’s strength is passed on to the new leader. 

The tribe leaders and their families reside in the largest monster carcass within the tribe’s territory. This carcass is known as the Usrak or the protector in their tongue. It is their duty to maintain its integrity as it symbolizes the continued survival of the tribe. 

### Geographic Information

The country of Qroaz has no particular regions of note. There are six tribes that constitute six major cities, but the country has no minor cities. At the northernmost tip of the country, just south of [[Groku island]], is Sullurarth city. To the northwest, at the foot of [[Mount Kikijith]], is Birti city. To the northeast is Retestrirt city while to the center is Tov city. At the southeastern tip, west of [[Jujozaxl island]], is Jhorge city. Finally, to the west of Jhorge and south of Birti is Birkias city.

### Multinational Organizations and Involvement

All the multinational organizations have struggled to create any roots in Qroaz except one: the [[Void Space Legion]]. The organization has many bases of operations in the vast free lands of the country. It is believed that many of their training operations happen here.
