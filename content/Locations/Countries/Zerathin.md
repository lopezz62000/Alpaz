Country: "[[Zerathin]]"
---
Zerathin is primarily inhabited by the Tieflings, but it is also home to many of the outcasted species of Alpaz. 

Since [[2. The Division|The Division]], the Tieflings were always hated by the other nations. It was believed that devils, whom they descended from, had a hand in causing the start of the Dawn War. Although this was never confirmed, the Tieflings were persecuted anyways. This, however, was all undone when a Tiefling by the name of [[Sivvean]] helped reunite the worlds during [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]].

Having experienced all this, the nation believed that no other species should experience the same outcasting. Hence, they invited all species to make their home within the lands of Zerathin. 

Recently, during [[4. The Calm|The Calm]], it appears than many of the magical abilities of the Tieflings disappeared. The number of its sorcerers dwindled and even those who used to perform arcane arts could no longer continue doing so. During this time, blood magic spread in the lands of Zerathin along with the emergence of Bloodhunters although it is believed that many have been practicing since the founding of the nation.

Zerathin is a great ally of the [[Race United]], many of the Tiefling serving as soldiers in its army. In addition, they serve as rescue squads, taking any displaced people and giving them a place to stay in Zerathin. They are also big customers of [[Leafwalker Industries]] and [[Alight Entertainment]], making sure to provide the best comfort for all people living in Zerathin. They do, however, have a slight distaste for [[Urifir Bookbasin]], believing that history could be tainted with lies, resulting in their unfortunate history. 

### Governmental Structure

A council of thirteen mages, also known as the Blood Circle, governs Zerathin. It is technically a magocracy although it is actually possible for someone without any magical capabilities to become a part of this council. This is because anyone can challenge a member of the Blood Circle. The challenger can name their own terms, but it is up to the member to accept. Should the challenge be accepted and the challenger wins, the challenger replaces the member in the Blood Circle. Any one time thereafter, if the new member is challenged by the ex-member in the same challenge, the new member of the Blood Circle must accept. Finally, when a member of the Blood Circle dies without a deciding replacement, the rest of the members choose the new member. The decision must be made unanimously. 

For all these reasons, someone without magical capabilities can become part of the ruling body of this magocracy. However, the structure makes it very difficult to do so. Still, due to these deciding methods, the members of the Blood Circle are incentivized to keep improving in their specialties. The hope is that such practice increases their capabilities in governing the country.
