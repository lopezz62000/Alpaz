Country: "[[Kllurian]]"
---
Out of all the nations, the elves of Kllurian are the most religious due to their innate connection with their deities. During [[2. The Division|The Division]], they were locked out of their heaven and their main deity, Corellon, disappeared. Desperate for answers, some of the elves began to worship Lolth and pillaged many sources of knowledge in the Far Ranian and Ajysial kingdoms. They even led an uprising against the high elves who protected the [[Golden Grove]] of Hidden Knowledge, accusing them of their current predicament. However, they made no success in restoring what was once a beautiful afterlife. Instead, those elves turned into the Drow, scorned by all the countries of Nol. There were also other elves who served a new deity, the Raven Queen, who promised a way into heaven for all elves. However, their operations were sabotaged, turning her helpers into the Shadarkai. 

Speaking of the [[Golden Grove]], it is said that some elves were still able to practice and deepen their magical abilities with the help of the Nether Scrolls and Solen crystals. Such power, however, was only ever used to protect the elves from roaming orcs and goblins as well as increasing their lifespan.

By [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]], the elves found themselves able to return to their heaven once again. Still, Corellon was not to be found. The elves became a divided nation. The eladrin decided to be of service to other powers including the fey whom they allowed to make a home in their lands. The high elves dedicated themselves to the preservation of all elven traditions and continued to be caretakers of the [[Golden Grove]]. The wood elves went about exploring the world and sharing their knowledge with its people. 

During [[4. The Calm|The Calm]], an old deity came to some power: Eilistraee, the only good Drow deity. With her help, the many elves were brought under one command, and a new heaven was found for the elves. For the first time in many ages, the Drow and Shadar-kai were allowed to live in the lands of Kllurian.

The country is indebted to [[Urifir Bookbasin]] which they continue to help rebuild and preserve. The Elves are also quite fond of [[Alight Entertainment]] as their new deity is a god of song and dance, so the elves have taken it upon themselves to learn such arts from the best around the world. The elves however are indifferent to [[Leafwalker Industries]] since they make better equipment, and they have a distaste for [[Siaga]] because they perpetuate technologies that threaten the importance of magic in everyday life. Finally, the country is a strong ally to the [[Race United]], supporting each otherâ€™s militaries at times of need.

### Governmental Structure

The Kllurian elves have always been under a theocracy. Each deity in the Elven pantheon appoints a clergyman to be their representative. In addition, the pantheon appoints a leader for each of the major cities. Together, they form the Golden Council. Once appointed as a member of the Golden Council, these Elves receive messages from the Elven pantheon through their trances which they do instead of sleeping. The main goal of the council is to ensure the continued connection of the Elves to their deities, which primarily means protecting the [[Golden Grove]] and preserving the power of their deities. 

Prior to [[2. The Division|The Division]], it was only Corellon who made decisions within the Golden Council. Hence, when their connection to him was severed during [[2. The Division|The Division]], the Golden Council took desperate measures to try and repair that connection. Hence, they ordered the Elven armies to pillage other countries for magical resources and forcing their faith to many cities outside of Kllurian. However, none of this work. Instead, they turned to the other deities to make decisions within the council. 

### Geographical Information

Kllurian is split into two main regions. 

The first is the Grasslands region to the north. In the northwestern most part of the country just south of [[Austere Beast Pass]] is Eyildi city. On the northeastern side, near [[Rosemond hills]] is Sylyra city. Finally, between the two cities, hugging [[Scratch Rock range]] is Adronai city.
