Located at the eastern end of [[Kilrakir Peaks]] and just north of [[Zofrika Pride]] and south of [[Fallion Pride]].

At its peak stands Cliff Hall where the council of the Dragonborn, The Flight of Flames, resides and oversees operations. A day before The Flight changes, a flame in the shape of wings appears at its peak for an extended period of time.

Mount Kikijith is in the shape of a dragon about to take flight. It is believed to be a great wyrm golden dragon, with its webbed wings coming together to form the sides of the mountain. Its mountain sides are specked with gems that gleam and glow a golden bright light at any time of the day, similar to the regional effects of a golden dragon. Some people believe that monstrous beings roam the mountains deep caves and are haunted by nightmares, believing that the dragon from which the mountain sprouted is threatening them. Although still believed to be effects of the golden dragonâ€™s spirit (only against evil creatures), the people believe their experiences too real to be simple illusions.
