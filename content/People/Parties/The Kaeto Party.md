The Kaeto Party is a group of adventurers made up of [[Andrew Osorin|Andy]], [[BRX-962|Bruiser]], [[Jokarius Heirophant|Jokyr]], [[Laeryn]], [[Qric]], [[Yusef Gravemore|Yusef]], and [[Zaigan]]. Full information [here](https://saga.so/s/px2kqOeueJRWctECCi9v/339b2ac7-a746-4db4-9f5f-547d6566e215).

### Arc I: Demon's Debut

The party forms in [[Faycub Metropolis]], a halfling city in the country of [[Neoland]]. They initially find the sketchy Mutant Queens band who tries to harvest magical body parts from attendees of a poetry night event. They discover that the Mutant Queens have been infiltrating the [[Void Space Legion]], an underground organization that gives magical implants to patrons. Upon investigating the location, they find and retrieve Vilhara's Vanity Box, an abyssal artifact that allows someone to transform into a fiend. However, the Mutant Queens are nowhere in sight. Warwin offers to bring them to the Mutant Queens practice venue. Upon arrival to a spaceship-like building called The Heart of the Star , Warwin steals the artifact and gives it to the Mutant Queens, allowing them to open a portal to the Abyss.

While killing off most of the Mutant Queens, [[Fraz-urb'luu]] and many demons escape through the portal. The party quickly reports to the police after saving a stray child called [[Agile]]. The party is tasked to help evacuate the city since the warforged have been going haywire. After some investigation, they use the life-seeking warforged as leverage, making them target demons instead of humans. They then focus on city evacuation and confront [[Fraz-urb'luu]], killing him and the other demons in the city which all turn into white sand.

### Arc II: Curse of the Hollow Heart

Vintra wants to meet up with [[Yusef Gravemore|Yusef]] to discuss some plans with the organization, taking Felix hostage. They quickly save Felix who stays with the party for protection.

[[Zaigan]] is cursed after keeping Vilhara's Vanity Box. His condition worsens after learning that the people responsible for the death of his family were [[Yusef Gravemore|Yusef]]'s family. When he begins to involuntarily transform into a demon, they decide to deal with Vintra later and take a trip into the 176th layer of the Abyss. There, they find that the white sand is controlled by [[Fraz-urb'luu]] to make demons and clones. They try to find the demon lord in order to get the curse removed, but they all fall for his deceptive tactics. In the end, [[Agile]] sacrifices his life to save [[Zaigan]].

Along the way, they learn that [[Fraz-urb'luu]] is working with Lolth, the deity Vintra serves. However, they set this aside to save [[Agile]].

### Arc III: Chaos of Magic

The party discovers that [[Agile]] was part of an adventuring party called [[the Explorer]] party. Their journals detail their travel through the cosmic elemental planes, the alien magic they find, and how they gained a form of immortality. They set out to find one of [[the Explorer]] party members in order to learn how [[Agile]] can be saved.

They learn about a prodigy who has been selling new spells which appear to align with cosmic magic. Taking their chances, they join the Spelling Bee and find that the prodigy is a little girl named [[Quilkira Aalrac|Rowan]] – a missing friend of [[BRX-962|Bruiser]].

Before they can leave the venue, however, disaster strikes and the party goes to save two of [[Andrew Osorin|Andy]]'s old acquaintances who were attacked in the woods. Here, the party splits. [[Andrew Osorin|Andy]] and [[Laeryn]] go to a crash site where [[Andrew Osorin|Andy]] vaguely remembers a formless creature that attacked him and his friends. The rest go to an old temple, taking down cultists and obyriths in order to save the kidnapped people. When they regroup and share information, the party decides to go back to the temple both to clear it of obyriths and perhaps find the bodies of [[Andrew Osorin|Andy]]'s old friends. In the process, they intercept an ongoing ritual and are transported to Voidharrow where they kill the Chaos God.

### Arc IV: Hopeful Song

The party decides to get some rest and spends a day at the carnival. There, they meet Emery who has been concerned about oddities in the forest – more specifically, the lack of chaos. Knowing a possible cause of this, [[Zaigan]] calls for some divine aid, contacting Savras and asking the deity to come down. The god of divination complies and informs the party that a replacement deity would be needed. The party surmises that deity of the chaotic good drow, Eillistraee, might be a good fit to which the deity agrees, pointing them to the Crescent isles.

Upon arrival, the party finds that there is no drow on the island. Instead, the party discovers that the islands have become a base of operations, with the devils building weapons, transportation, and an army of new creatures. After freeing an imprisoned drow and getting chased by an island of enemies, Eillistraee opens a portal for them, transporting them to the unnamed island of the drow.

There, they find the sworddancers, including Ginoon, the bearer of the white Arcobaleno ring, [[Wanothee]], the Keeper of Space, and [[Reysta Summerburst|Reysta]], an old friend of [[Jokarius Heirophant|Jokyr]] and Emery. As the party learns of their history, the meet Eillistraee and ask her to take the position of the chaos triune. Given the large shoes to fill and the lack of protection the good drow have, she does not comply. Instead, she offers information about [[Asmodeus]]' possible plans and gives some possible information
