Andrew Osorin (a.k.a. Andy) is a 5'6 half-elf sporting black poofy hair with fading streaks of pink. Portions of his body appear silvered due to too much body glitter. Despite his adventuring life, he is wearing luxurious light-weight business casual. More specifically, he has an ascot shirt, tailored waistcoat, and lightly patterned pants. All this is switched with a more sleek black color scheme complete with an almost-too-large top hat. He is a draconic sorcerer who hides behind self-proclaimed titles, unaware of his true lineage.

### Arc I: Demon's Debut

Andy has a rough start: his friend [[Meepo]] is killed and his ex-boyfriend Wes turns into a weretiger. In hopes of curing Wes and training his magical skills, he joins the party of adventurers. He ends up venturing into the Heart of the Star, confronting the Mutant Queens and saving a human-tiger hybrid that looks like Wes. Upon returning to the Kami-Eun Sanctum, the sorcerer finds two weretigers and successfully determines which one is Wes, curing him of his lycanthrope. Given the immediate dangers in the city, however, Wes decides to go back home for the time being. Before he does so, he gives Andy his first official title as Herald of Hearts - which he can do since he is technically the lord of a piece of land.

### Arc II: Curse of the Hollow Heart

The sorcerer continues adventuring with [[the Kaeto Party]], scouting for the team and making quick work of enemies from afar. The party is joined by [[Laeryn]] who learns that a member of the party (later turning out to be Andy) has a past shrouded in history, one involving an ascended entity from another world.

### Arc III: Chaos of Magic

In search of a prodigy, the party joins a Spelling Bee. Since Andy has had bad experiences with the competition, avoids getting attention from some acquaintances. However, upon meeting Showan, his past mentor, he is forced to dig up the past. He learns that the cart crash which killed two of his friends back in boarding school could have been caused by Fastrada Leafwalker. After winning the competition, the party goes to investigate, Andy does not find any foul play in the crash, but he learns that the bodies taken by a group of monsters and cultists can still be found in an underground temple. Hopeful, Andy goes to the temple to retrieve even a part of their bodies while Showan gets some spells to help bring them back. In the process, Andy faces the creatures which took the lives of his friends and the god that gave them entrance into this world.

### Connection to Vordaron

Apparently, he is Vordaron's great great great great great great grandson. He still does not know what exactly this connection is since his draconic lineage comes from his missing mother. All he has to go off of right now is a seemingly normal long sword and a dream from a bejeweled dragon.

Andy's whereabouts are unknown. It appears that a glitch in the world occurred and they disappeared.
