## Life as Jokarius

Jokarius is an aasimar warlock. He met [[Sivvean]] and [[Kyren]] in [[Greffol City]]. 

They soon learn of the existence of Gulians in Nol (specifically the Hag Coven) who are afraid of the Nologites, and are finding ways to fight back. Together with [[Kyren]], they investigate on the whole situation and found out that a prominent magic user, Riam, has been attacking the capital and finding a way to open the portal, resulting in retaliation between the Humans and the Gulians in [[Eitur]]. Knowing that they can't fight Riam or open the portal just yet, they journey to [[Ilor]], the Kingdom of the Dwarves, to gather magical resources and learn how the portal can be opened. After doing this and having converting Riam to their side, they quickly return to the portal.

As the portal reopened, the party was met with another party. Now home, [[Sivvean]] found themselves in a new mission to protect it against Lumiseth. Together, as [[The Agents of Chaos]], and with the armies of both Gul and Nol, they go up against the dragonborn army and Lumiseth. Disguised as part of the dragonborn army and with most of the army occupied by their forces, the party heads into the castle. There, they go up against Lumiseth and the elementals he controls with many [[elemental weapons]] he has collected. In no time, the king is defeated and the spirit of the Zekyll crushed.

During [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]] and after [[Xion Aalrac|Xion]]'s death, Kyren took it upon himself to lead the [[Race United]]. For the past hunred years, Kyren has led the efforts to remove conflicts from the world. Now, he has decided to step down, opening the spot for another leader. 

## Life as Jokyr

Jokyr is a 17-year-old aasimar acolyte of Kami-Eun with blue hair and opal eyes. Although it looks like he is shirtless, he is actually wearing a shirt and armor (well usually). He just has an unexplainable condition where his top always turns invisible. If you don't believe it, he will convince you otherwise – just as he has persuaded many others into doing other things. He has regular pants and a drama mask with stars where its eyes should be which he places that on the top of his head. His best friend, "Paul," is a massive 10-foot long scythe. He is a paladin of Kami-eun and a warlock of Yaldabaoth. However, due to his past and his being abandoned by the latter, he has set out to kill the gods until he finds what he wants – a certain friend.

### Arc I: Demon's Debut

Jokyr was hired as a private investigator along with [[Yusef Gravemore|Yusef]]. He proves his strength to the party during their first encounter by killing off [[Meepo]] and convincing several warforged to ignore the crime – which activates their need for true life, making them go haywire. When the party tracks down the Mutant Queens, they encounter a war titan, a huge fiend of a million faces. Jokyr tries to activate his powers but is faced with a choice: to remember memories from his past life or to activate his powers. Similar choices come up repeatedly when he has encounters against any group of fiends.

This culminates during the month-long demon clean up after the battle against [[Fraz-urb'luu]]. Upon trying to gain his final memory, Yaldabaoth, the god of Chaos, appears to Jokyr in a vision, informing the palading of his disappointment for bringing order instead of chaos into the world. The deity suspects that this has to do with Kami-eun returning Jokyr's memories about a friend he has lost to the chaos of war in the past, a past Jokyr seeks to fix. Hence, Yaldabaoth gives Jokyr the choice to regain all his memories and lose all his power or retain his power and have the whole world forget the friend that he is searching for. Jokyr chooses the latter and decides to cut all ties with the deity. Kami-eun rewards Jokyr with the powers of a seraph.

### Arc II: Curse of the Hollow Heart

The paladin charges into the heart of the Abyss as the sword and shield of the party. In the Hollow Heart's Mansion, he finds the story of his previous party on the stained-glass windows. However, he does not recognize two creatures who appear to have been taken away from the party and turned into devil servants of [[Asmodeus]]. As they venture further, he meets a half-tiefling half-devil creature in one of the prison cells. The creature is reluctant to receive any help, appearing not to want any acquaintances – much more friends. Jokyr gives the creature his number but forgets to ask its name.

### Arc III: Chaos of Magic

Jokyr becomes more "adventurous" both during and after the Spelling Bee. Upon investigating the temple and uncovering [[Andrew Osorin|Andy]]'s past, they find that a creature is being served as a pseudo-deity by stray monks from [[Laeryn]]'s monastery. They also learn that the pseudo-deity is using all the sacrifices it has received to give power to Yaldabaoth, allowing it to break from its chains. Soon, they find that Yaldabaoth actually shares a body with the Demiurge and Tharizdun. Together, they make the Chaos God, each deity representing the neutral, good, and evil side of chaos. Imbued with the power to kill gods from the divine embers, the party sets out to kill Tharizdun, but Jokyr, having the final blow, uses all his power to kill both Yaldabaoth and the Demiurge. Now, the world is devoid of chaos.

### Jokyr's Past

Jokyr was previously Jokarius Heirophant. Few know of his past lives, most of whom are in [[The Agents of Chaos]] party. He was given chances to reincarnate by Yaldabaoth. Throughout his time, he has been searching for someone he has lost.

The fragments of his memory are as follows:

> "To your right is an 8 year-old child, about 4ft 7 in height. The sides of their head shaved, while the rest of their light brown hair braided to about back length. You look at your right arm and you notice a lightly tanned hand with a slight yellow glow pulling at you. The child looks at you and you notice their and dark yellow eyes that sparkle like topaz. 'Do you still need this?' the child says pointing to an intricate piece of machinery. You take a closer look and you recognize it as the green controller you still have. 'No, sweetie, this is a piece of history, one that we must never forget,' you say. 'But aunt [[Quilkira Aalrac|Quilkira]] said that she needed more parts for my hydro speedster.' You lift the child up to your shoulders, similar to how you carried [[Andrew Osorin|Andy]] at the Golden Goblin. 'Tell [[Quilkira Aalrac|Quilkira]] this was from the mechanical dragon we destoryed during the great war.' The child frowns, and activates their puppy eyes. 'Please, papa?' "

> "Blood, blood everywhere. As you open your eyes, you see blood, a giant purple worm, a basilisk, and a bombardier beetle dead in front of you. An imp lies on top of your chest and with the last of your strength you raise your scythe and slit its throat. A mound of flesh rises from _your_ pool of blood. 'No more, Jokarius.' A voice echoes. /Your last is gone, your time has come.' Without saying a word, you let a single indigo crystal roll out of your pockets. This humanoid of pure flesh, with thousands of tendrils stemming out of him, picks up the crystal and examines it. 'You know, you can't save him.' it says as your flesh begins to simultaneously burst and repair itself, 'A deal is a deal,' he continues. You stand up and walk away as it swallows the crystal whole. But it stops and a gurgling sound can be heard. It spits the crystal out, and hurls it in your direction. You catch the crystal with your right hand, now green and lifeless, a fake. You turn around with a smirk and you say, 'A deal is a deal'. You walk away in the direction of the ocean."

There were two other memories. The first is an underwater fight between a deep scion and a half-elf half-devil. The second is a fight in hell where a half-tiefling half-devil commands an army against Jokarius.
