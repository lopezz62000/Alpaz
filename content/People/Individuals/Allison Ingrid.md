Alli is a moon elf with fair skin and long black hair worn in low pigtails, which nearly reach her waist. She’s roughly 5’4” and wiry as a child, but she moves through the world with an elegance beyond her years. Her closet is full of straight, sleeveless, shift or tent dresses of various colors and fabrics, and she wears a gold and sapphire teardrop choker around her neck that she never, ever takes off. She is always in ballet flats.

### Arc I: Demon's Debut

Alli is a rising pop star whose debut performance is in Feycub Metropolis. However, she is overshadowed by the already famous Mutant Queens. Wanting to take them down, she joins the party for a bit. Along the way, she meets [[Daemyar]] from the [[Void Space Legion]] who seems to know her. However, the party rushes off to deal with the Mutant Queens and, later on, the demons. After the battle with [[Fraz-urb'luu]], she is confronted by [[Daemyar]] who tells her that her missing mother was [[Daemyar]]'s close friend and the one who helped her turn into a famous singer through mutations. [[Daemyar]] gives her a choker which, combined with hers, creates an interactive hologram of her mother and her last words for her daughter. After this, Alli decides to quit a life of adventuring to tour the world.

While she was touring the world, she landed upon the untouched creativity of the Vedalken in [[Ultor Municipality]]. Inspired, she decided to start [[Alight Entertainment]] in order to share their creativity with the rest of the world.
