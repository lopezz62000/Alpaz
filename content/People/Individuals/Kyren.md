Party: "[[The Agents of Chaos]]"
---
Kyren is an elven rogue. He met [[Sivvean]] and [[Jokarius Heirophant|Jokarius]] in [[Greffol City]]. 

They soon learn of the existence of Gulians in Nol (specifically the Hag Coven) who are afraid of the Nologites, and are finding ways to fight back. They investigate on the whole situation and found out that a prominent magic user, Riam, has been attacking the capital and finding a way to open the portal, resulting in retaliation between the Humans and the Gulians in [[Eitur]]. Knowing that they can't fight Riam or open the portal just yet, they journey to [[Ilor]], the Kingdom of the Dwarves, to gather magical resources and learn how the portal can be opened. After doing this and having converting Riam to their side, they quickly return to the portal.

As the portal reopened, the party was met with another party. Now home, Sivvean found themselves in a new mission to protect it against Lumiseth. Together, as [[The Agents of Chaos]], and with the armies of both Gul and Nol, they go up against the dragonborn army and Lumiseth. Disguised as part of the dragonborn army and with most of the army occupied by their forces, the party heads into the castle. There, they go up against Lumiseth and the elementals he controls with many [[elemental weapons]] he has collected. In no time, the king is defeated and the spirit of the Zekyll crushed.

During [[3. The Great Unification|The Great Unification]] and after [[Xion Aalrac|Xion]]'s death, Kyren took it upon himself to lead the [[Race United]]. For the past hunred years, Kyren has led the efforts to remove conflicts from the world. Now, he has decided to step down, opening the spot for another leader.
