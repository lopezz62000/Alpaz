Rowan is a 3"5' human with medium-length wavy red hair put up in braids. She is the daughter of Hanz Phillips who owns a warforged factory. She is currently about 12 years old, but she has been good friends with [[BRX-962|Bruiser]] since she was 8. Turns out, Rowan is, in fact, the reincarnated Quilkira, the Energy explorer.

### Session 13 - A [[BRX-962|Bruiser]]'s Humanity

The party goes to the warforged factory to figure out why the robots are going haywire. When [[BRX-962|Bruiser]] meets Hanz, he asks if there has been any news of Rowan. The factory owner mentions that only Fastrada knows where Rowan is.

### Session 17 - Goodbye, [[Allison Ingrid|Alli]]

Hanz sets up a meeting with Fastrada where [[BRX-962|Bruiser]] asks about Rowan's whereabouts. The businesswoman simply mentions that she has made a business deal, causing Rowan to be in the hand of the elves.

### Session 30 - Onwards to [[Eyildi Vale]] - Session 47

Looking for a member of [[the Explorer]] party, the party finds children's coloring books that have new forms of magic. They trace them back to a prodigy in the Spelling Bee who uses Energy-affiliated spells. The child turns out to be Rowan.

Rowan comes help the party in terms of dealing with the obyriths and cultists. She does mention that this will be temporary as she still needs to pay back for Fastrada. In their time together, Rowan reveals to [[BRX-962|Bruiser]] that she is Quilkira and that her brother's soul is in [[BRX-962|Bruiser]].

> The plane is heavily guarded by the dragons of energy as great powers and souls residing in the plane must be protected. The dragons will not relent to good or bad intentions. [[The Explorer]] party were not attacked only because [[Quilkira Aalrac|Qilkira]] was chosen as the keeper of the Energy plane's power. The party never learned why, although they speculate that it has something to do with the draconic blood flowing through her and her undying energy to help others.

> The plane of Energy is a border transitive plane. In form, the plane is an exact clone of the material plane. However, any color, sound, taste, or any other sensation is much more vibrant and pleasing. The souls of those who die and the spirits of all other things in the prime material plane reside in the plane. However, the souls of those who die can be claimed only by higher powers after some time depending on certain conditions. If ownership of a soul is in dispute, the soul is hoarded by the Energy dragon in the Risen Peaks.
