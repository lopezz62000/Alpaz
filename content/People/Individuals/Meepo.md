Meepo is a 2'6" kobold. He has yellow scales, blue eyes, and is exceptionally ugly â€“ like you can't look at him for too long. He is a necromancer that died before he could raise anyone from the dead.

### Session 1 - The Beginning

Meepo is in town with [[Andrew Osorin|Andy]], hoarding coupons and La Crox. When he visits the Golden Goblin to join the poetry night event, a drunk [[Jokarius Heirophant|Jokyr]] kills him. His head has served as a medusa-like item to this day.

_Meepo was made to fool with the DM on the very first episode. It has not yet come back to bite them. However, Meepo's siblings have been spotted in the Spelling Bee._
