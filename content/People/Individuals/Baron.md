Baron is a half-elven druid. 

He met [[Aster Winterhurst|Aster]], [[Wolfgang]], and [[Meili Hue|Meili]] in [[Gue Xus Fort]]. The rest of the party tells the Blood Circle everything they know about Lumiseth and the portal and the [[elemental weapons]]. The tiefling council strongly suggests that they get help but the only help they can get is from the other side of the closed portals. Hence, the party sets off to work to undo the locks placed on the portals. However, Baron tells them of a powerful human wizard named Riam from Nol who may have caused the closing of the portals and placed the locks on them. The allegiances of Riam is unknown so they may have to put up a fight against him once the portals open. 

As the portal reopened, Riam was on the other side along with [[Sivvean]], [[Jokarius Heirophant|Jokarius]], and [[Kyren]]. Before they could attack, the other side explains that Riam is now on their side and is working to go up against Lumiseth. Together, as [[The Agents of Chaos]], and with the armies of both Gul and Nol, they go up against the dragonborn army and Lumiseth. Disguised as part of the dragonborn army and with most of the army occupied by their forces, the party heads into the castle. There, they go up against Lumiseth and the elementals he controls with many [[elemental weapons]] he has collected. In no time, the king is defeated and the spirit of the Zekyll crushed.

With the war against the elementals over, the party celebrates. Baron goes on to help [[Jokarius Heirophant|Jokarius]] and [[Quilkira Aalrac|Quilkira]] find [[Sivvean]] years after he and [[Aster Winterhurst|Aster]] go into hell.

Baron's full story is detailed in [[HIDDEN B]]. Today, he and [[Laeryn]] are often found in [[Nyssira Pride]] and [[Gue Xus Fort]].
