Qric is an aarakocra with mostly black feathers and little white spots â€“ kind of resembling feathers of a magpie. He is 5'5" in height and weighs about 80 lbs. His outer clothing is tattered, making his monk robes slightly visible. His overall aesthetic is that of a pirate, as there are bands of different cloths around his waist, making a sort of gradient of blue to brown. He has bandage wraps around his hand talons. He also wears a set of specially design bracers for battles in the ocean, the dark abyss, and the surface. The bracers seem to hide something as well, as there are compartment openings on the underside of his bracers. Qric is a reformation monk, here to give [[Zaigan]] some time to recover and place [[Laeryn]] back onto her destined path.
