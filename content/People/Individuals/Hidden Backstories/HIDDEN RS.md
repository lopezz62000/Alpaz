When [[Aster Winterhurst|Aster]] joined [[Asmodeus]] in hell, he was transformed into a half-elf half-devil. Along with [[HIDDEN LR]], they travelled the world searching for the rest of the elemental weapons. 

After his duties with the devil was completed, [[Jokarius Heirophant|Jokarius]] was able to free him from his contract. He found his way to the [[Crescent Isles]], receiving treatment for his half-devil curse with the Ellistraean drow. After telling [[The Kaeto Party]] about the location of [[Sivvean]] and the situation with [[Asmodeus]], his ritual was completed with the help of the party.

Today, he has returned to [[Dreamsprout]] to be reunited with [[Sarkiar d'Poacery|Sarkiar]] in [[Waterspout Grove]].
