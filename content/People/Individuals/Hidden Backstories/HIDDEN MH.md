[[Meili Hue|Meili]] kept experimenting with SheeLDs. Their potential as a new drug was great, but she refused to let it fall into the hands of other business people. She worked to establish [[Void Space Legion]]. With the use of SheeLDs, they have been able to rejoin bones and fuse flesh to flesh. As a result, they were able to provide new hope and new abilities to those who needed it. Over time, they meet [[Daemyar]] and Roxanne Ingrid who join the [[Void Space Legion|VSL]] and establish its new purpose as an underground group of mercenaries and vigilantes who would solve the problems the other organizations refuse to address.
