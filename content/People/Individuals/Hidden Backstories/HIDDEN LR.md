When [[Aster Winterhurst|Aster]] was forced to journey into hell, [[Sivvean]] knew that [[Asmodeus]] was up to something. Hence, he journeyed into hell with [[Aster Winterhurst|Aster]], allowing himself to be transformed into a half-devil and became [[Lord Rakdos]]. When [[Jokarius Heirophant|Jokarius]] freed them both from their contracts, [[Sivvean]] remained as Lord Rakdos, pretending to be a loyal servand to the lord of the nine hells. There, he kept track of the devil's plan and waited for someone to take that information and use it against [[Asmodeus]]. 

When [[The Kaeto Party]] arrived, he was relieved. He was able to tell them about the Ecattil and the massive amount of power [[Asmodeus]] was gathering up for himself, all while using [[Blood War]] as a distraction to the gods. With his help, [[The Kaeto Party]] was able to warn the gods and come back just in time to stop [[Asmodeus]]. With the lord of the nine hells dead, [[Sivvean]] remains in hell.
