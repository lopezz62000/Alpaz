> Fleeting Snow is the mother of [[Tranquil Snow]]. When [[4. The Calm|The Calm]] began, her son, then around 20 years old, disappeared. She searched far and wide for him, but she never found him. All she found were his research notes, much like the [[Tranquil Snow]] of the past, about how the world was ending and that he needed to find a solution. 
> One day, an much older [[Tranquil Snow]] appeared in the burrow that Fleeting Snow never left. He gave her a Ruby Rod and said "Use this to save me" before disappearing, glitching out of existence.
