Party: "[[The Explorer]]"
---
Agile, a male half-demon who, filled with heart and mind, could steer any ship through a storm without breaking composure.

 >Agile, Emotion Explorer "Not sure why, but my gut says 'Hope' is the strongest emotion. Or 'Love'? No, no, definitely 'Hope'."
> 
> When [[The Explorer]] visited the emotion plane, they were given a chance to receive its power through tests. The tests involved exposing the candidates to the 8 purest emotions. If they were to react to any of it, they would fail. In addition, they were required to be able to exhibit these 8 pure emotions themselves. [[Agile]], being a bouda who has prevented himself from eating other creatures and doing harm as a demon, was the only person to pass this test. At the end of the 16 tests, they gained the power of the Emotion plane.
> 
> The plane of Emotion is a border transitive plane. The plane is filled with small bits of matter formed from the thoughts of creatures in the prime material plane of objects that have entered this transitive plane. For this reason, it is filled with many chaotic shapes, stretching for miles. Surrounding space is also filled with multicolored mist, each one connecting a different emotion. The rest is a gray void.
> 
> - Joy is the most fragile.
> - Love, the most resilient.
> - Terror, the most dangerous.
> - Grief is the darkest emotion.
> - Loathing, the most persistent.
> - Fury, the most draining.
> - Hope, the strongest.
