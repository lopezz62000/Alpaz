Party: "[[The Kaeto Party]]"
---
Zaigan is an aasimar, though he doesn't like letting people know that. He is 6-foot tall with tannish gold skin which gives off a subtle glow that's barely noticeable in the dark. He has dirty blond hair and beautiful eyes with gold tints in them. He has a scar that goes from his neck to under his shirt. Initially, his clothes, consisting of a hooded tonic, battle trousers, and a mask, are tattered and his breastplate is covered in dried blood. However, this has been changed to a two-colored short-sleeved hooded cloak, a dark blue tunic, gilded trousers, military boots, and a pure black mask. He also has bandage wraps on both of his wrists and hands, but only one gauntlet for the mace-bearing hand - the other is probably for holding his bottle that brews any alcoholic drink for him on the fly. Despite being a time domain cleric, Zaigan has yet to deal with his past.

### Arc I: Demon's Debut

Zaigan is initially [[Allison Ingrid|Alli]]'s friend and bodyguard. Since [[Allison Ingrid|Alli]] wants to get back at the Mutant Queens, she and Zaigan join the party. As a drunk cleric, he usually rushes to the forefront of battle, taking blows while the rest deal damage. When the party unknowingly saves [[Agile]] from the Mutant Queens, Zaigan becomes the child's caretaker. From the cleric, [[Agile]] learns how to speak and fight â€“ although the child is only relearning it with him.

### Arc II: Curse of the Hollow Heart

After attuning to Vilhara's Vanity Box, Zaigan is cursed. Although he initially tries to control it, his condition worsens when he learns that [[Yusef Gravemore|Yusef]]'s family was responsible for his own family's death and his dark life as part of the Gladeborn Guild. After learning this, his angel guide, Dehran comes. However, he only arrives to tell him that he'll be leaving for a while and needs to attend to the sleeping gods.

Without much help, the curse causes Zaigan to involuntarily transform into a Lunar Devil, attacking the party and trying to run away from them. Upon dying, Zaigan transforms back into his original form, but the party still has to resurrect him. When they successfully do so, Zaigan explains that the curse and the party try to figure out how to stop it. In the end, they decide to venture into [[Fraz-urb'luu]]'s layer of the Abyss. In the process, [[Fraz-urb'luu]] is able to trick the party into leaving Zaigan and himself alone, allowing him to accelerate the curse to its final stage: creating a new body for the soul of the demon lord. When the party returns, they are unable to find a way to reverse the curse. [[Agile]], during the last moments, decides to take Zaigan's place.

### Arc III: Chaos of Magic

In order to save [[Agile]], the party goes to find the prodigy. However, as the Spelling Bee comes to a close and the party comes back from the underground temple, Zaigan's emotional state worsens. As a result Zaigan drunkenly calls on [[Qric]] to take him home. The following day, Zaigan goes back to Northhaven and [[Qric]] joins the party on their way to the bottom of the underground temple.

### Connection to Cosmic Planes

Zaigan gets some of his powers from the cosmic plane of time. However, Zaigan has never gone to the cosmic planes. He has only received knowledge about the cosmic plane of time from [[Baron]], a member of [[the Explorer]] party who received the powers of chronomancy and ended up as a demigod. The issue is that, when Zaigan last tried to contact [[Baron]], he appears to have turned back into a baby.
