Wanothee is a celestial cartographer who would be known for mapping out all of Alpaz, gaining him the title of [[The Explorer]].

> [[Wanothee]], Space Explorer "My name suspiciously sounds like a number. But what are characters and numbers aside from 'meaningful space'."

> The Explorers had an issue when trying to explore the seemingly endless Space plane. To be specific, the form of the ship suddenly changed, launching the members of the party into random directions. Each person was lost for several days, and, despite their powers, were unable to fix the situation. [[Wanothee]], one of the last members of The Explorer who was powerless, was chanced upon the Space dragon who took pity on them. The dragon gave [[Wanothee]] the power of the Space plane. Using their newfound power, they were able to bring the party back together, navigating the Space plane to find the Space dragon and thank him. However, because the power overwhelmed them, under certain circumstances, [[Wanothee]] suddenly disappears and teleports into a random nearby location.

> The plane of Space is a border transitive plane. Its landscape is all but shadow. All light in the plane shines for half its original radius, although it can be seen from any distance. Shadow versions of living creatures exist in the plane. Any actions of living creatures can have an impact on the landscape of the plane. The Dragon of Space uses the plane as a prison for the excess evil in people, hoping that it may never escape the never ending landscape of the plane.
