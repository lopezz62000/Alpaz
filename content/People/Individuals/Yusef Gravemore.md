Yusef Gravemore is a 6'2" drow elf with dark greyish skin and a slightly thin build. He has very long white hair that goes into a ponytail to keep it tame. His eyes are ruby red and his voice is soft and low. His left ear has a red earring. He wears a collared long-sleeve shirt under a vest and constantly holds an umbrella to keep away from the sun. His smile and good posture make him appear welcoming and respectable, although it is partly to keep a "good" appearance within a society where drow aren't really accepted. With him is a familiar named Lois which takes the form of a hawk. He is a conjuration wizard with a knack for jewelry that comes from a questionable family history.

### Arc I: Demon's Debut

Yusef was hired as a private investigator along with [[Jokarius Heirophant|Jokyr]]. In his time away, he is in constant communication with Felix, his housemate. Starting with the battle against the Mutant Queens, he uses the Ring of Proliferation and Box of Summoning to comfort and support the party.

When the warforged go haywire, Yusef investigates footage where the warforged are trying to use a ritual to gain a new body. He figures out that the victims were all necromancers, positing that [[BRX-962|Bruiser]]'s erroneous code and [[Jokarius Heirophant|Jokyr]]'s reprogramming of some warforged has caused the warforged to want to attain true life. [[Andrew Osorin|Andy]] uses this information to help them fight against the demons who have been released into the city. Once the city has been cleared, Yusef spends some time with Felix on vacation.

### Arc II: Curse of the Hollow Heart

Vintra, a drow who has been turned into a drider, calls Yusef, revealing to the party that his true name is Corvus Ved'mir and is Vintra's sister. Upon hearing that Yusef is a Ved'mir, [[Zaigan]] goes into an outrage, activating the curse brought on by Vilhara's Vanity Box. They also find that Vintra has put Felix in a cocoon of death and save him from Vintra. Without hesitation, Yusef uses his magic to switch positions with Felix, putting himself in the cocoon of death. When the others frantically try to break him free, they activate a glyph that causes Yusef's death.

During his state of death, he is confronted by Lolth who labels him as a zwy'il or candidate. The deity explains that he will be put under a series of four tests to prove his strength as a drow, the first of which was the interview they were having in a room of spiders. She also reveals that Vintra has failed her final test, but has been given a chance to redeem herself.

After talking to Lolth, Yusef comes back to life. [[Jokarius Heirophant|Jokyr]]'s sudden comment that he will officiate at their wedding startles Felix who suddenly proposes to the wizard. Yusef says yes to Felix's relief.

The artificer stays with the party until they figure out what Yusef's sister is planning. For the time being, Felix tries to be a source of comfort for Yusef and tries to reconcile him with [[Zaigan]]. When [[Zaigan]]'s condition worsens, Yusef does not hesitate to go into the Abyss to find [[Fraz-urb'luu]] and get the curse removed.

### Arc III: Chaos of Magic

Yusef leads the party in the Spelling Bee, strategizing for each event. After the championship, he uses his keen mind to guide the party through the underground temple, solving puzzles and escaping encounters. Once they reach Voidharrow, he wastes many of the Chaos God's actions whilst staying as far away as possible to keep concentration.

Yusef has settled into [[Beinrin Vale]] with Felix. It is believed they have a private mine in [[Cos Xoc City]], allowing them to nurture precious gems for their own production.
