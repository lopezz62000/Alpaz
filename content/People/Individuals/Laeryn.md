Laeryn is a wood elf with copper skin and bright green eyes. She is a brunette and has her hair tied up into a braid that rests on her left shoulder. She sports short brown boots, long sleeve white shirt, and a leather-type corset around the abdomen. In the past few years, she has practiced the monastic tradition of mercy as a monk, learning through the Ascension Monastery. Furthermore, Laeryn has a unique relationship with a deity known as the Demiurge, the purpose of which is she has yet to discover.

### Arc II: Curse of the Hollow Heart

Laeryn is introduced to the party by Lieutenant Olo as a hero who helped save a hundred lives amidst the battle against [[Fraz-urb'luu]]. After receiving rewards from the [[Kyren]] and the [[Race United]], she hears the voice of a deity telling her to to come outside. There, she meets Uncle Smo and a little boy referred to as [[Wanothee|103]]. The old man asks Laeryn if she knows about a member of [[the Kaeto Party]] involved in a mysterious accident involving an ascended creature, one alien to this world. Although she does not know such a person, the old man tells him to look into it and find someone who has a history with the Spelling Bee competition. Thinking this may have something to do with her monastery and the deity talking to her, she stays with the party. Along the way, she watches [[Zaigan]]'s curse grow, helping him fight it. She even joins the party as they venture into the Abyss in order to deal with the curse once and for all.

### Arc III: Chaos of Magic

Laeryn seems to be avoided by many dangers throughout the Spelling Bee and the journey afterward. In the bee farm, she is avoided by the bees that try to sting the other creatures. When the puzzle gate opened, everyone in the vicinity except her is covered in poison by the small obyriths. Finally, in the battle against the Chaos God, even Tharizdun himself avoids attacking Laeryn. Through all this, Laeryn finds that the Demiurge has al her protector.

During the many visits to the temple, Laeryn realizes that the Demiurge and Yaldabaoth are one â€“ which is a problem because [[Jokarius Heirophant|Jokyr]] hates Yaldabaoth. Even worse, upon entering Void Harrow, she learns that Tharizdun is also the same being as the Demiurge. She also learns that the Demiurge is looking for a new protector of the world and that Laeryn was a candidate, which explains the protection she's been receiving. Knowing that destroying Tharizdun will be the party's plan going forward, Laeryn and her co-monk [[Qric]] try to find a way to keep the Demiurge alive whilst getting rid of Tharizdun. They promise to return the divine embers to the Demiurge, hoping to give it enough power to stay alive, but the embers were not returned in time. Hence, when [[Jokarius Heirophant|Jokyr]] killed Tharizdun, the Demiurge and Yaldabaoth were both killed as well

Today, she and [[Baron]] are often found in [[Nyssira Pride]] and [[Gue Xus Fort]]. She runs a temple in [[Nyssira Pride]] to the demiurge and a monastery in [[Gue Xus Fort]]. She constantly teaches people to fight their fate if they don't like it -- even if it looks impossible to fight.
