> Large underground group of mercenaries and vigilantes

Void Space Legion is an underground group of individuals that spans the entire world. Their exact goals are unknown, but they practice many things that might seem questionable to many. This includes grafting monster parts onto humans, travel through the ethereal plane, and the holding onto pieces of a soul for remembrance. Despite their questionable means, many believe that the Void Space Legion is harmless. Instead, they simply exist to help those who are in desperate situations. Rumors say that the Void Space Legion helped quell the demonic uprising that occurred in the country of [[Neoland]]. No official statements have been released by the organization about anything. In fact, the existence of a leader in the organization is unknown.
