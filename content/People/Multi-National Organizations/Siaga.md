> Major research and development organization of Alpaz

Siaga is the research and development organization in Alpaz. Their main research facility is in [[Fiffeek City]] in the country of [[Eitur]]. It was established in honor of the late inventor [[Tranquil Snow]]. [[Tranquil Snow]] was a recruited Arcanoengineer who was talked with creating technologies that could protect the portal between Nol and Gul during [[2. The Division|The Division]]. They discovered the power of Solen crystals (later found to hold Divine Embers by [[the Kaeto Party]]) and invented Tinker Boxes (items that created magic-like effects for non-casters). 

Today, Siaga has major research facilities around the world. Each facility has different specialties including everyday utilities, robotics, magical sustainability, resource sustainability, and otherworldly connections. Anyone who has a bright idea or unique skills is welcomed into the organization and given teams to collaborate with.
