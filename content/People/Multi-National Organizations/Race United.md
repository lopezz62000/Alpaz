> Main military body in Alpaz

The Race United serves as the main military body in Alpaz. Its headquarters is located in [[Fallion Pride]]. It was once led by a high elf named [[Kyren]] who was advised by the United Council, a council of representatives from almost every country in Alpaz. However, during [[4. The Calm|The Calm]], [[Kyren]] decided to step down from his position, leaving the United Council to lead the organization as one body. Before doing so, [[Kyren]] fully decommissioned all warforged, robots that were made to enforce the law of the Race United and the different countries it represents. This was done by uploading a piece of code from the first free-willed warforged: [[BRX-962]] aka [[BRX-962|Bruiser]]. From then on, all warforged were free to roam the world of their free will and can rejoin The Race United if they so wish.

Today, The Race United has military outposts in almost all countries and regions. They have several divisions focused on different aspects such as law enforcement, community outreach and civil disputes, crisis response, and paranormal watch. Together, they work to ensure that all citizens of Alpaz feel safe and comfortable.
