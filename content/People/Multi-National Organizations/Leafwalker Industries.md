> Most successful business corporation in Alpaz

Leafwalker Industries is the major business corporation in Alpaz. They have invested in several large businesses including Shooting Star Hotels, Hymnrun’n’Himrrun, and Lift. Upon their success, they were ushered into membership with the corporation. Most adventurers would know of these businesses as the major providers of their adventuring needs.

The firm was founded by Fastrada Leafwalker in the country of [[Neoland]] where its headquarters is located. However, she disappeared sometime before [[4. The Calm|The Calm]]. The new CEO of the company is Aura Osorin, a relatively unknown businesswoman who seems to have information on otherworldly investors. Under her leadership, Leakwalker Industries established fair pricing regulations, anti-trust laws, and quality control.
