> Largest educational institution in Alpaz

Urifir Bookbasin is the largest educational institution in Alpaz. The name used to refer to just one ancient library that was maintained by the Firbolg race. However, the kind and generous people decided to expand, establishing library branches and schools all over Alpaz. Hence, Urifir Bookbasin now refers to the organization of libraries and schools. Urifir Bookbasin schools are known for providing the best in adventuring education, helping people grasp the beginning abilities in their class.

To this day, the ancient library still stands in the country of [[Ajysius]]. It has records from times of old and is rumored to have records from the future as well. Information here can be found in stones, magical holograms, books, and computers. The organization is excited to receive any new piece of information. In fact, it’s most famous book is Photosynthesize, a series of proverbs submitted in the last century by [[Wolfgang]].
