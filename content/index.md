title: Welcome to the Alpaz Almanac

## Intro

Hello! This is the world almanac of Alpaz. The world of Alpaz is where all my campaigns and one shots take place (except the ones on Telofim, you know who you are). I've roughly kept track of its stories in a set of documents in an effort to create a unified lore. However, I never had the time to put everything together. Now that I've had some time, I finally got to put enough of it together. Lore from my first 2 campaigns (3 if you count the Nol and Gul campaigns separate) are 90% here and allusions to all my one shots are here. 

Still, it's a work in progress. So much has happened in this world. I don't even have the main world events there yet – or pictures! I do know that I cannot cover all of it alone. I can't even cover what I have now accurately. Hence, if you have any information you want to add, please please please let me know.

Anyways, enjoy!

## Before You Read

The information in this Almanac is what I consider public knowledge to the people of Alpaz. However, some documents here are marked as HIDDEN or REDACTED. 

HIDDEN documents store information that is not public knowledge, but is knowledge that I allow players to know. Be aware that, when playing characters, they are most likely not privy to this knowledge. However, if you have a backstory reason to know this information, let me know.

REDACTED documents store information that is known to me and only me. I don't have an efficient way of keeping files full private with Obsidian, and I want to prevent having to keep things up to date in multiple places. So, for now, they will be here.

When opening these documents, you will be reminded of these things. 

## Background

Alpaz is a world where everything has found it place. That does not mean that no conflicts exist. In fact, it is quite the opposite of that. If you are looking for necromancers, large devil armies, or warmongering robots, you'll find them in here. But if you are looking for a place where monsters live a modern mundane life, a place where tribes who don't know common are in war, or a place where the trees constantly party, you can also find them.

How?

Alpaz used to be split in two different worlds: Gul where magic thrived and Nol where technology thrived. Separately, they developed their own sets of cultures and specialties. Then, when the veil was lifted, they were able to thrive with each other. With varying levels of cultural mixing, every city became very unique. Any adventure you wish to find, you will find here.

Of course, there are constants within each region. There's the [[Race United]] who serve as the military body all over the world. [[Leafwalker Industries]] which sponsors most of the merchants. [[Siaga]] and [[Alight Entertainment]] which bring the most advanced technology and best entertainment you need wherever you go. Finally, there's [[Urifir Bookbasin]] as the trusted source of truth found in your local library, or data center, or pile of rocks. 

Together, they keep the world and its chaos of cultures together – somewhat.
